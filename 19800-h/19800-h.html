<h1 class="tei tei-head" style="text-align: left; margin-bottom: 3.46em; margin-top: 3.46em"><span style="font-size: 173%">PREFACE.</span></h1>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of the numerous works that have been written
on London, by which I mean more especially
the City of London, few have been devoted to an
adequate, if indeed any, consideration of its political
importance in the history of the Kingdom. The
history of the City is so many-sided that writers
have to be content with the study of some particular
phase or some special epoch. Thus we have those
who have concentrated their efforts to evolving
out of the remote past the municipal organization
of the City. Their task has been to unfold the
origin and institution of the Mayoralty and Shrievalty
of London, the division of the City into wards with
Aldermen at their head, the development of the
various trade and craft guilds, and the respective
powers and duties of the Courts of Aldermen and
Common Council, and of the Livery of London
assembled in their Common Hall. Others have
devoted themselves to the study of the ecclesiastical
and monastic side of the City's history—its Cathedral,
its religious houses, and hundred and more parish<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageiv">[pg iv]</span><a name="Pgiv" id="Pgiv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
churches, which occupied so large an extent of the
City's area. The ecclesiastical importance of the City,
however, is too often ignored. "We are prone,"
writes Bishop Stubbs, "in examining into the municipal
and mercantile history of London, to forget
that it was a very great ecclesiastical centre."
Others, again, have confined themselves to depicting
the every-day life of the City burgess, his social condition,
his commercial pursuits, his amusements; whilst
others have been content to perpetuate the memory
of streets and houses long since lost to the eye,
and thus to keep alive an interest in scenes and
places which otherwise would be forgotten.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The political aspect of the City's history has
rarely been touched by writers, and yet its geographical
position combined with the innate courage
and enterprise of its citizens served to give it no
small political power and no insignificant place in
the history of the Kingdom. This being the case,
the Corporation resolved to fill the void, and in
view of the year 1889 being the 700th Anniversary
of the Mayoralty of London—according to popular
tradition—instructed the Library Committee to prepare
a work showing "the pre-eminent position
occupied by the City of London and the important
function it exercised in the shaping and making of
England."</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagev">[pg v]</span><a name="Pgv" id="Pgv" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is in accordance with these instructions that
this and succeeding volumes have been compiled.
As the title of the work has been taken from a
chapter in Mr. Loftie's book on London ("Historic
Towns" series, chap. ix), so its main features are
delineated in that chapter. "It would be interesting"—writes
Mr. Loftie—"to go over all the
recorded instances in which the City of London
interfered directly in the affairs of the Kingdom.
Such a survey would be the history of England
as seen from the windows of the Guildhall." No
words could better describe the character of the
work now submitted to the public. It has been
compiled mainly from the City's own archives.
The City has been allowed to tell its own story.
If, therefore, its pages should appear to be too
much taken up with accounts of loans advanced
by the City to impecunious monarchs or with
wearisome repetition of calls for troops to be raised
in the City for foreign service, it is because the
City's records of the day are chiefly if not wholly
concerned with these matters. If, on the other
hand, an event which may be rightly deemed of
national importance be here omitted, it is because
the citizens were little affected thereby, and the
City's records are almost, if not altogether, silent on
the subject.</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagevi">[pg vi]</span><a name="Pgvi" id="Pgvi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The work does not affect to be a critical history
so much as a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">chronique pour servir</span></span>, to which the
historical student may have recourse in order to learn
what was the attitude taken up by the citizens of
London at important crises in the nation's history.
He will there see how, in the contest between
Stephen and the Empress Matilda, the City of
London held as it were the balance; how it helped
to overthrow the tyranny of Longchamp, and to
wrest from the reluctant John the Great Charter of
our liberties; how it was with men and money
supplied by the City that Edward III and Henry V
were enabled to conquer France, and how in after
years the London trained bands raised the siege of
Gloucester and turned the tide of the Civil War in
favour of Parliament. He will not fail to note the
significant fact that before Monk put into execution
his plan for restoring Charles II to the Crown, the
taciturn general—little given to opening his mind to
anyone—deemed it advisable to take up his abode
in the City in order to first test the feelings of the
inhabitants as to whether the Restoration would be
acceptable to them or not. He will see that the
citizens of London have at times been bold of speech
even in the presence of their sovereign when the
cause of justice and the liberty of the subject were at
stake, and that they did not hesitate to suffer for<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagevii">[pg vii]</span><a name="Pgvii" id="Pgvii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
their opinions; that, "at many of the most critical
periods of our history, the influence of London
and its Lord Mayors has turned the scale in
favour of those liberties of which we are so justly
proud"; and that had the entreaties of the City
been listened to by the King and his ministers, the
American Colonies would never have been lost to
England.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are two Appendices to the work; one
comprising copies from the City's Records of letters,
early proclamations and documents of special interest
to which reference is made in the text; the other
consisting of a more complete list of the City's
representatives in Parliament from the earliest times
than has yet been printed, supplemented as it has
been by returns to writs recorded in the City's
archives and (apparently) no where else. The returns
for the City in the Blue Books published in
1878 and 1879 are very imperfect.</p>

shores of the Baltic.<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href="#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a> Small wonder, then, if the City
of London was quick to profit by the continuous
stream of traffic passing and repassing its very door,
and vindicated its title to be called—as the Venerable
Bede had in very early days called it the Emporium
of the World.<a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href="#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But if London's prosperity were solely due to its
geographical position, we should look for the same unrivalled
pre-eminence in commerce in towns like
Liverpool or Bristol, which possess similar local
advantages; whilst, if royal favour or court gaieties
could make cities great, we should have surely
expected Winchester, Warwick, York, or Stafford
to have outstripped London in political and commercial
greatness, for these were the residences of
the rulers of Mercia, Northumbria, and Wessex, and
the scenes of witena-gemóts long before London
could boast of similar favours. Yet none of these
equals London in extent, population, wealth, or
political importance.</p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">The tenure of the City of London compared with other boroughs.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We must therefore look for other causes of
London's pre-eminence, and among these, we may
reckon the fact that the City has never been subject
to any over-lord except the king. It never formed a
portion of the king's demesne (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">dominium</span></span>), but has
ever been held by its burgesses as tenants <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in capite</span></span> by
burgage (free socage) tenure. Other towns like<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page003">[pg 003]</span><a name="Pg003" id="Pg003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc8" id="toc8"></a>
Bristol, Plymouth, Beverley, or Durham, were subject
to over-lords, ecclesiastical or lay, in the person of
archbishop, bishop, abbot, baron or peer of the
realm, who kept in their own hands many of the
privileges which in the more favoured City of London
were enjoyed by the municipal authorities.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the early part of the twelfth century, the town
of Leicester, for instance, was divided into four parts,
one of which was in the king's demesne, whilst the
rest were held by three distinct over-lords. In course
of time, the whole of the shares fell into the hands of
Count Robert of Meulan, who left the town in
demesne to the Earls of Leicester and his descendants;
and to this day the borough bears on its shield the
arms of the Bellomonts.<a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a> The town of Birmingham is
said, in like manner, to bear the arms of the barons
of that name; the town of Cardiff, those of the De
Clares; and Manchester, those of the Byrons.
Instances might be multiplied. But the arms of
the City of London and of free boroughs, like
Winchester, Oxford, and Exeter, are referable to no
over-lord, although the borough of Southwark still
bears traces in its heraldic shield of its former
ecclesiastical connection.</p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">The powers of an over-lord.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The influence of an over-lord for good or evil,
over those subject to his authority, was immense.
Take for instance, Sheffield, which was subject, in the
reign of Elizabeth, to the Earl of Shrewsbury. The
cutlery trade, even in those days, was the main-stay of
the town, and yet the earl could make and unmake
the rules and ordinances which governed the Cutlers'<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page004">[pg 004]</span><a name="Pg004" id="Pg004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Company, and could claim one half of the fines imposed
on its members.<a id="noteref_5" name="noteref_5" href="#note_5"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When, during the reign of Charles II, nearly
every municipal borough in the kingdom was forced
to surrender its charter to the king, the citizens of
Durham surrendered theirs to the Bishop, who, to
the intense horror of a contemporary writer, reserved
to himself and his successors in the See the power
of approving and confirming the mayor, aldermen,
recorder, and common council of that city.<a id="noteref_6" name="noteref_6" href="#note_6"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a></p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">London under the Roman Empire.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The commercial greatness of London can be
traced back to the time of the Roman occupation of
Britain. From being little more than a stockaded fort,
situate at a point on the river's bank which admitted
of an easy passage by ferry across to Southwark, London
prospered under the protection afforded to its
traders by the presence of the Roman legions, but it
never in those days became the capital of the province.
Although a flourishing centre of commerce in the middle
of the first century of the Christian era, it was not
deemed of sufficient importance by Suetonius, the
Roman general, to run the risk of defending against
Boadicea,<a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7" href="#note_7"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a> and although thought worthy of the title of
Augusta—a name bestowed only on towns of exceptional
standing—the Romans did not hesitate to
leave both town and province to their fate as soon
as danger threatened them nearer home.</p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">Roman highways.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For military no less than for commercial purposes—and
the Roman occupation of Britain was
mainly a military one—good roads were essential, and
these the Romans excelled in making. It is remarkable
that in the Itinerary of Antoninus Pius, London
figures either as the starting point or as the terminus to
nearly one-half of the routes described in the portion
relating to Britain.<a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href="#note_8"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a> The name of one and only one
of these Roman highways survives in the city at the
present day, and then only in its Teutonic and not
Roman form—the Watling or "Wathelinga" Street,
the street which led from Kent through the city of
London to Chester and York, and thence by two
branches to Carlisle and the neighbourhood of Newcastle.
The Ermin Street, another Roman road with
a Teutonic name, led from London to Lincoln, with
branches to Doncaster and York, but its name no
longer survives in the city.</p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">London bridge and the city wall.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same reasons that led the Romans to
establish good roads throughout the country led
them also to erect a bridge across the river from
London to Southwark, and in later years to enclose
the city with a wall. To the building of the bridge,
which probably took place in the early years of the
Roman occupation, London owed much of its youthful
prosperity; whenever any accident happened to
the bridge the damage was always promptly repaired.
Not so with the walls of the city. They were allowed
to fall into decay until the prudence and military
genius of the great Alfred caused them to be repaired
as a bulwark against the onslaughts of the Danes.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Britain had been occupied by the Romans, but
had not become Roman,"<a id="noteref_9" name="noteref_9" href="#note_9"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a> and the scanty and superficial
civilization which the Britons had received
from the Roman occupation was obliterated by
the calamities which followed the northern invasions
of the fifth and following centuries. A Christian
city, as Augusta had probably been, not a vestige of
a Christian church of the Roman period has come
down to us.<a id="noteref_10" name="noteref_10" href="#note_10"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">10</span></span></a> It quickly lapsed into paganism.
Its very name disappears, and with it the names
of its streets, its traditions and its customs. Its inhabitants
forgot the Latin tongue, and the memories
of 400 years were clean wiped out. There remains to
us of the present day nothing to remind us of London
under the Roman empire, save a fragment of a wall,
a milestone, a few coins and statuettes, and some
articles of personal ornament or domestic use—little
more in fact, than what may be seen in the Museum
attached to the Guildhall Library. The long subjection
to Roman rule had one disastrous effect. It
enervated the people and left them powerless to cope
with those enemies who, as soon as the iron hand of
the Roman legions was removed, came forth from
their hiding places to harry the land.</p>

So runs the Anglo-Saxon chronicle, and this is the
sole piece of information concerning London it vouchsafes
us for one hundred and fifty years following
the departure of the Romans. The information,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page008">[pg 008]</span><a name="Pg008" id="Pg008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
scant as it is, serves to show that London had not
quite become a deserted city, nor had yet been devastated
as others had been by the enemy. Its
walls still served to afford shelter to the terrified
refugees.</p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">London, the metropolis of the East Saxons.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When next we read of her, she is in the possession
of the East Saxons. How they came there is a matter
for conjecture. It is possible that with the whole of
the surrounding counties in the hands of the enemy,
the Londoners were driven from their city to seek
means of subsistence elsewhere, and that when the
East Saxons took possession of it, they found houses
and streets deserted. Little relishing a life within a
town, they probably did not make a long stay, and, on
their departure, the former inhabitants returned and
the city slowly recovered its wonted appearance,
as the country around became more settled.</p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">Mellitus, the first Bishop of London, </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-size: 80%; font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span><span style="font-size: 80%"> 604.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Christianity in the country had revived, and London
was now to receive its first bishop. It is the year
604. "This year," writes the chronicler, "Augustine
hallowed two bishops, Mellitus and Justus; Mellitus
he sent to preach baptism to the East Saxons, whose
king was called Seberht, son of Ricula, the sister of
Ethelbert whom Ethelbert had there set as king.
And Ethelbert gave to Mellitus a bishop's see at
London." This passage is remarkable for two
reasons:—(1) as shewing us that London was at this
time situate in Essex, the kingdom of the East Saxons,
and (2) that Seberht was but a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">roi fainéant</span></span>, enjoying
no real independence in spite of his dignity as ruler of
the East Saxons and nominal master of London, his
uncle Ethelbert, king of the Cantii, exercising a hegemony<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page009">[pg 009]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc11" id="toc11"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hence it is that London is spoken of by some as
being the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">metropolis</span></span> of the East Saxons,<a id="noteref_15" name="noteref_15" href="#note_15"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">15</span></span></a> and by

fact being that, though locally situate in Essex, it was
deemed the political capital of that kingdom which
for the time being happened to be paramount.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After the death of Seberht, the Londoners
became dissatisfied with their bishop and drove him
out. Mellitus became in course of time Archbishop
of Canterbury, whilst the Londoners again relapsed
into paganism.<a id="noteref_17" name="noteref_17" href="#note_17"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">17</span></span></a> Not only was the erection of a cathedral
in the city due to Ethelbert, but it was also at
his instigation, if not with his treasure, that Seberht,
the "wealthy sub-king of London," was, as is
believed, induced to found the Abbey of Westminster.<a id="noteref_18" name="noteref_18" href="#note_18"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">18</span></span></a></p>

London began to take a more prominent place among
the cities of the kingdom, notwithstanding its having
been three times destroyed by fire between 674 and
801.<a id="noteref_19" name="noteref_19" href="#note_19"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">19</span></span></a> It became more often the seat of the royal
residence, and the scene of witena-gemóts; nevertheless
it was not the seat of government, much less the
capital. Then and for a long time to come it had a
formidable rival in Winchester, the chief town of
Egbert's own kingdom of Wessex. To Winchester
that king proceeded in triumph after completing the
union of the Saxon kingdoms, and thither he
summoned his vassals to hear himself proclaimed
their overlord. From Winchester, Alfred, too, promulgated
his new code of Wessex law—a part of the
famous <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Domboc</span></span>, a copy of which is said to have been
at one time preserved among the archives of the City
of London<a id="noteref_20" name="noteref_20" href="#note_20"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">20</span></span></a>—and the Easter gemót, no matter where
the other gemóts of the year were held, was nearly
always held at Winchester. When it came to a
question of trade regulation, then London took
precedence of Winchester. "Let one measure and
one weight pass, such as is observed at London and
at Winchester,"<a id="noteref_21" name="noteref_21" href="#note_21"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">21</span></span></a> enacted King Edgar, whose system

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Danes, like the Angles and the Jutes before

preferring always to defend themselves by combat in

Alfred on the other hand, London, with its surrounding

be acquired and kept at all hazards. At length he

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whilst the enemy directed their attention to
further conquests in France and Belgium, Alfred bent
his energies towards repairing the City walls and
building a citadel for his defence—"the germ of that

Kings, and then the scene of the martyrdom of their
victims."<a id="noteref_26" name="noteref_26" href="#note_26"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">26</span></span></a> To his foresight in this respect was it due
that the city of London was never again taken by
open assault, but successfully repelled all attacks whilst
the surrounding country was often devastated.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor did Alfred confine his attention solely to
strengthening the city against attacks of enemies
without or to making it more habitable. He also laid
the foundation of an internal Government analagous
to that established in the Shires. Under the year <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span>

"the keeping of the aldorman Æthelred." In course
of time the analogy between shire and city organization
became more close. Where the former had its
Shiremote, the latter had its Folkmote, meeting in St.
Paul's Churchyard by summons of the great bell.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For the next ten years Alfred busied himself
founding a navy and establishing order in different
parts of the country, but in 896 he was compelled to
hasten to London from the west of England to assist
in the repulse of another attack of the Danes. Two
years before (894) the Danes had threatened London,
having established a fortification at Beamfleate or
South Benfleet, in Essex, whence they harried the
surrounding country. The Londoners on that occasion
joined that part of the army which Alfred had left
behind in an attack upon the fort, which they not only
succeeded in taking, but they "took all that there was
within, as well money as women and children, and
brought all to London; and all the ships they either
broke in pieces or burned, or brought to London or
to Rochester."<a id="noteref_29" name="noteref_29" href="#note_29"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">29</span></span></a> Nor was this all: Hasting's wife
and his two sons had been made prisoners, but were
chivalrously restored by Alfred.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Danes, however, were not to be daunted by
defeat nor moved from their purpose by the generous
conduct of Alfred. In 896 they again appeared.
This time they erected a work on the sea, twenty
miles above London. Alfred made a reconnaissance<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page014">[pg 014]</span><a name="Pg014" id="Pg014" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

their vessels and escaped across country, and "the men

ships, and all those which they could not bring off

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The principle of each man becoming responsible
to the Government for the good behaviour of the
neighbour, involved in the system of frankpledge
which Alfred established throughout the whole of his
kingdom, subject to his rule, was carried a step further
by the citizens of London at a later date. Under
Athelstan (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 925-940) we find them banding
together and forming an association for mutual defence
of life and property, and thus assisting the executive
in the maintenance of law and order. A complete
code of ordinances, regulating this "frith" or peace
gild, as it was called, drawn up by the bishops and

and for making good to members any loss they may
have sustained. So far, the gild undertook duties of a
public character, such as are found incorporated among<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg 015]</span><a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc14" id="toc14"></a>

also its social and religious side. When the ruling

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some writers see in the "frith-gild" of Athelstan's
day, nothing more than a mere "friendly society,"
meeting together once a month, to drink their beer
and consult about matters of mutual insurance and
other topics of more or less social and religious
character.<a id="noteref_34" name="noteref_34" href="#note_34"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">34</span></span></a> But there is evidence to show that the
tie which united members of a "frith-gild" was
stronger and more solemn than any which binds the
members of a friendly society or voluntary association.
The punishment of one who was guilty of breaking
his "frith" was practically banishment or death.
Such a one, in Athelstan's time, was ordered to abjure
the country, which probably meant no more than that
he was to leave his burgh or perhaps the shire in
which he dwelt, but if ever he returned, he might be
treated as a thief taken "hand-habbende" or one
taken with stolen goods upon him, in other words,
"with the mainour."<a id="noteref_35" name="noteref_35" href="#note_35"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">35</span></span></a> A thief so taken might lawfully
be killed by the first man who met him, and the
slayer was, according to the code of the "frith-gild,"<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page016">[pg 016]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

Under these circumstances, it is more reasonable to
suppose, that the "frith-gild" was not so much a
voluntary association as one imposed upon members
of the community by some public authority.<a id="noteref_37" name="noteref_37" href="#note_37"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">37</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The commercial supremacy of London, not only
over Winchester but over every other town in the
kingdom, now becomes more distinct, for when Athelstan
appointed moneyers or minters throughout the
country, he assigned eight (the largest number of
all) to London, whilst for Winchester he appointed
only six, other towns being provided with but one or
at most two.<a id="noteref_38" name="noteref_38" href="#note_38"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">38</span></span></a> The king, moreover, showed his
predilection for London by erecting a mansion house
for himself within the city's walls.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The encouragement which Athelstan gave to
commercial enterprise by enacting, that any merchant

courage displayed by its inhabitants and the
protection which, by Alfred's foresight, the walls were
able to afford them. In 994, Olaf and Sweyn sailed
up the Thames with a large fleet and threatened to
burn London. Obstinate fighting took place, but the
enemy, we are told, "sustained more harm and evil
than they ever deemed that any townsman could do
to them, for the Holy Mother of God, on that day,
manifested her mercy to the townsmen and delivered

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Matters might not have been so bad had not the
king already committed the fatal error of attempting
to secure peace by buying off the enemy. In 991, he
had, with the consent of his witan, raised the sum of
£10,000 with which he had bribed the Danish host.
This was the origin of the tax known as Danegelt,
which in after years became one of the chief financial
resources of the Crown and continued almost uninterruptedly
down to the reign of Henry II. The effect
of the bribe was naturally enough to induce the
enemy to make further depredations whenever in
want of money; and accordingly, a Danish fleet
threatened London the very next year (992) and
again in 994. On this last occasion, the same wretched
expedient was resorted to, and the Danes were again
bought off.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor was cowardice the only charge of which
Ethelred was guilty. To this must be added treachery
and murder. In the year 1002, when he married the
daughter of the Duke of Normandy, hoping thereby<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page018">[pg 018]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to win the Duke's friendship and to close the harbours
on the French coast against Sweyn, Ethelred issued
secret orders for a massacre of all Danes found in
England. In this massacre, which took place on the
Festival of St. Brice (13th Nov.), perished Gunhild,
sister of Sweyn. Under these circumstances, it can
scarcely be wondered at, that thenceforth the Danish
invasions became more frequent, more systematic, and
more extensive than ever.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For four years they continued their depredations
"cruelly marking every shire in Wessex with burning
and with harrying." Then they were again bought
off with a sum of £36,000, and two years' respite
(1007-8) was gained.<a id="noteref_41" name="noteref_41" href="#note_41"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">41</span></span></a> It was a respite and no more.
As soon as they had spent their money, they came
again, and in 1009 made several assaults on
London—"They often fought against the town of
London, but to God be praise that it yet stands
sound, and they have ever fared ill."<a id="noteref_42" name="noteref_42" href="#note_42"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">42</span></span></a> Every year

more anxious to capture London, because Ethelred

king. The English, however, compelled as they had
been by superior strength to submit to the father,
were in no mood to accept without a struggle the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Ethelred arrived in England, he was accompanied
according to an Icelandic Saga,<a id="noteref_49" name="noteref_49" href="#note_49"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">49</span></span></a> by King Olaf,
of Norway, who assisted him in expelling the Danes
from Southwark, and gaining an entrance into the
city. The manner in which this was carried out, is
thus described. A small knot of Danes occupied a
stronghold in the City, whilst others were in possession
of Southwark. Between the two lay London Bridge—a
wooden bridge, "so broad that two waggons
could pass each other upon it"—fortified by barricades,
towers, and parapets, and manned by Danes.
Ethelred was naturally very anxious to get possession<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg 021]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc17" id="toc17"></a>
of the bridge, and a meeting of chiefs was summoned
to consult how it could be done. Olaf promised to
lay his fleet alongside the bridge if the English would
do the same. This was agreed upon. Having
covered in the decks of the vessels with a wooden
roof to protect the crew and fighting men, Olaf succeeded
in rowing light up to the bridge and laying
cables round its piers. This done, he caused his ships
to head down stream and the crews to row their
hardest. The result was that the piles were loosened
and the bridge, heavily weighted by the Danes who
were fighting upon it, gave way. Many were thrown
into the river, whilst others made good their retreat
to Southwark, which was soon afterwards stormed
and taken. This incident in connection with
Ethelred's return formed the subject of more than
one Scandinavian poem, of which the following
may serve as a specimen:—</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At Ethelred's death the Witan who were in
London united with the inhabitants of the city in
choosing Edmund as his successor. This is the first
recorded instance of the Londoners having taken a
direct part in the election of a king. Cnut disputed
Edmund's right to the crown, and proceeded to attack
the city. He sailed up the Thames with his fleet,
but being unable to pass the bridge, he dug a canal
on the south side of the river, whereby he was
enabled to carry his ships above bridge, and so invest
the city along the whole length of the riverside. To
complete the investment, and so prevent any of the
inhabitants escaping either by land or water, he<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page024">[pg 024]</span><a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

became master of London and king of all England.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the election of Cnut's successor which took
place at Oxford in 1035, the Londoners again played
an important part. This time, however, it was
not the "burhwaru or burgesses" of the City who
attended the gemót which had been summoned for
the purpose of election, but "lithsmen" of London.</p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">The lithsmen of London attend gemót at Oxford.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As to who these "lithsmen" were, and how they
came to represent the City (if indeed they represented
the City at all) on this important occasion much
controversy has arisen. To some they appear as
nothing more than the "nautic multitude" or "sea-faring
men" of London.<a id="noteref_63" name="noteref_63" href="#note_63"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">63</span></span></a> On the other hand, there
are those who hold that they were merchants who
had achieved thane right under the provisions of

still others who are inclined to look upon them as so
many commercial travellers who had made their way
to Oxford by river in the ordinary course of business,
and who happened by good fortune to have been in that
city at the time of a great political crisis.<a id="noteref_65" name="noteref_65" href="#note_65"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">65</span></span></a> The truth<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page026">[pg 026]</span><a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
probably lies somewhere between these extremes.
The "lithsmen" may not themselves have been
thanes, although they are recorded as having been at
Oxford with almost all the thanes north of the
Thames;<a id="noteref_66" name="noteref_66" href="#note_66"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">66</span></span></a> but that they were something more than
mere watermen, such as we shall see joining with the
apprentices of London at important political crises,
and that they were acting more or less as representatives
of the Londoners who had already acquired a
predominant voice in such matters, seems beyond doubt.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During the next thirty years London took no
prominent part in the affairs of the country, content if
only allowed to have leisure to mind its own business.
The desire for peace is the key-note to the action
of the citizens of London at every important crisis.
Without peace, commerce became paralyzed. Peace
could be best secured by a strong government, and
such a government, whether in the person of a king
or protector could count upon their support. "For
it they were ready to devote their money and their
lives, for commerce, the child of opportunity, brought
wealth; wealth power; and power led independence
in its train." The quarrels of the half-brothers,
Harold and Harthacnut, the attempt by one or both
of the sons of Ethelred and Emma to recover their
father's kingdom, and the question of the innocence or
guilt of Earl Godwine in connection with the murder
of one of them, affected the citizens of London only so
far as such disturbances were likely to impede the
traffic of the Thames or to make it dangerous for them
to convey their merchandise along the highways of
the country.</p>

so clear as in other cases. Nevertheless, the importance
of the citizens was daily growing, and by the time of

recognised as the capital of the kingdom, the chief

where the king usually resided.<a id="noteref_70" name="noteref_70" href="#note_70"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">70</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In early Saxon times the witan had met in any
town where the king happened at the time to be;
and although theoretically every freeman had a right
to attend its meetings, practically the citizens of the
town wherein the gemót happened at the time to be
held, enjoyed an advantage over freemen coming from
a distance. Alfred ordained that the witan should<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page028">[pg 028]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
meet in London for purposes of legislation twice a

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During the reign of Edward the Confessor, at
least six meetings of the witan took place in London;
the more important of these being held in 1051 and
the following year. By the gemót of 1051, which
partook of the nature of a court-martial, Earl Godwine
was condemned to banishment; but before a twelve-month
had elapsed, he was welcomed back at a great
assembly or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">mycel gemót</span></span> held in the open air without
the walls of London.<a id="noteref_72" name="noteref_72" href="#note_72"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">72</span></span></a> The nation had become
disatisfied owing to the king's increasing favour to
Norman strangers, but the earl desired to learn how
stood the City of London towards him, and for this
purpose made a stay at Southwark. He was soon
satisfied on this point. "The townsfolk of the great
city were not a whit behind their brethren of Kent
and Sussex in their zeal for the national cause. The
spirit which had beaten back Swend and Cnut, the
spirit which was in after times to make London ever
the stronghold of English freedom, the spirit which
made its citizens foremost in the patriot armies alike
of the thirteenth and of the seventeenth centuries,
was now as warm in the hearts of those gallant
burghers as in any earlier or later age. With a
voice all but unanimous, the citizens declared in
favour of the deliverer; a few votes only, the votes,
it may be, of strangers or of courtiers, were given<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page029">[pg 029]</span><a name="Pg029" id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc21" id="toc21"></a>

source;<a id="noteref_74" name="noteref_74" href="#note_74"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">74</span></span></a> although, one at least of the ancient chroniclers

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As soon as the news of Harold's coronation
reached William of Normandy, he claimed the crown
which Edward the Confessor had promised him. According
to every principle of succession recognised in
England, at the time, he had no right to the crown
whatever. When the Norman invader landed at
Pevensey, Harold was at York, having recently succeeded
in defeating his brother Tostig, the deposed
Earl of Northumbria, who, with the assistance of
Harold Hardrada, had attacked the northern earls,
Edwine and Morkere. On hearing of the Duke's
landing, Harold hastened to London. A general
muster of forces was there ordered, and Edwine and
Morkere, who were bound to Harold by family tie—the
King having married their sister—were bidden
to march southward with the whole force of their
earldoms. But neither gratitude for their late deliverance
at the hands of their brother-in-law, nor family
affection, could hurry the steps of these earls, and
they arrived too late. The battle of Senlac, better
known as the battle of Hastings, had been won and
lost (14th Oct., 1066), the Norman was conqueror, and
Harold had perished. For a second time within
twelve months the English throne was vacant.<a id="noteref_76" name="noteref_76" href="#note_76"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">76</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The times were too critical to hold a formal gemót
for the election of a successor to the throne; but the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page031">[pg 031]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc24" id="toc24"></a>
citizens of London and the sailors or "butsecarls"
(whom it is difficult not to associate with the "lithsmen"
of former days) showed a marked predilection in favour
of Edgar the Atheling, grandson of Edmund Ironside,
and the sole survivor of the old royal line. The
Archbishop, too, as well as the northern earls, were in
his favour, but the latter soon withdrew to their
respective earldoms and left London and the Atheling
to their fate.<a id="noteref_77" name="noteref_77" href="#note_77"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">77</span></span></a> Thus, "the patriotic zeal of the men
of London was thwarted by the base secession of the
northern traitors."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After waiting awhile at Hastings for the country
to make voluntary submission, and finding that homagers
did not come in, William proceeded to make a
further display of force. In this he betrayed no haste,
but made his way through Kent in leisurely fashion,
receiving on his way the submission of Winchester
and Canterbury, using no more force than was
absolutely necessary, and endeavouring to allay all
fears, until at length he reached the suburbs of
London.<a id="noteref_78" name="noteref_78" href="#note_78"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">78</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He had been astute enough to give out that he
came not to claim a crown, but only a right to be put
in nomination for it. To the mind of the Londoner,
such quibbling failed to commend itself, and the
citizens lost no time in putting their city into a posture<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page032">[pg 032]</span><a name="Pg032" id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of defence, determined not to surrender it without a

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Upon William's arrival in Southwark, the citizens
sallied forth. They were, however, beaten back after
a sharp skirmish, and compelled to seek shelter again
within their city's walls. William hesitated to make
a direct attack upon the city, but hoped by setting
fire to Southwark to strike terror into the inhabitants
and bring them to a voluntary surrender. He failed
in his object; the city still held out, and William next
resorted to diplomacy.</p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">Negotiations between William and the City.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ruling spirit within the city at that time
was Ansgar or Esegar the "Staller" under whom,
as Sheriff of Middlesex, the citizens had marched
out to fight around the royal standard at Hastings.
He had been carried wounded from the field, and
was now borne hither and thither on a litter, encouraging
the citizens to make a stout defence of
their city. To him, it is said, William sent a private
message from Berkhampstead, asking only that the
Conqueror's right to the crown of England might be
acknowledged and nothing more, the real power of
the kingdom might remain with Ansgar if he so
willed. Determined not to be outwitted by the
Norman, Ansgar (so the story goes) summoned a
meeting of the eldermen (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">natu majores</span></span>) of the City—the
forerunners of the later aldermen—and proposed
a feigned submission which might stave off immediate
danger. The proposal was accepted and a
messenger despatched. William pretended to accept
the terms offered, and at the same time so worked
upon the messenger with fair promises and gifts that
on his return he converted his fellow citizens and<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page033">[pg 033]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc25" id="toc25"></a>
induced them by representations of the Conqueror's
friendly intentions and of the hopelessness of resistance,
to make their submission to him, and to throw
over the young Atheling.</p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">London submits to the Conqueror.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whatever poetic tinge there may be about the
story as told by Guy of Amiens, it is certain that the
citizens came to the same resolution, in effect, as that
described by the poet, nor could they well have done
otherwise. The whole of the country for miles
around London, had already tendered submission or
been forced into it. The city had become completely
isolated, and sooner or later its inhabitants must have
been starved out. There was, moreover, a strong
foreign element within its walls.<a id="noteref_79" name="noteref_79" href="#note_79"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">79</span></span></a> Norman followers
of Edward the Confessor were ever at hand to counsel
submission. London submitted, the citizens accepting
the rule of the Norman Conqueror as they had
formerly accepted that of Cnut the Dane, "from
necessity." An embassy was despatched to Berkhampstead,
comprising the Archbishop of York, the
young Atheling, the earls Edwine and Morkere, and
"all the best men of London," to render homage and
give hostages,<a id="noteref_80" name="noteref_80" href="#note_80"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">80</span></span></a> and thus it was, that within three
months of his landing, William was acknowledged as
the lawfully elected King of England, and, as such, he
crowned himself at Westminster, promising to govern
the nation as well as any king before him if they
would be faithful to him.</p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">His charter to the citizens of London.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The conciliatory spirit of William towards the
Londoners is seen in the favourable terms he was
ready to concede them. Soon after his coronation—<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page034">[pg 034]</span><a name="Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the precise date cannot be determined—he granted

purpose not to reduce the citizens to a state of
dependent vassalage, but to establish them in all the
rights and privileges they had hitherto enjoyed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The charter, rendered into modern English, runs
as follows:—</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"William, King, greets William, Bishop, and Gosfregdh,
Portreeve, and all the burgesses within London,
French and English, friendly. And I give you to
know that I will that ye be all those laws worthy
that ye were in King Eadward's day.<a id="noteref_82" name="noteref_82" href="#note_82"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">82</span></span></a> And I will
that every child be his father's heir after his father's
day and I will not suffer that any man offer you any
wrong. God keep you."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The terms of the charter are worthy of study.
They are primarily remarkable as indicating that the
City of London was, at the time, subject to a government
which combined the secular authority of the
port-reeve with the ecclesiastical authority of the
bishop. It was said, indeed, to have been greatly
due to the latter's intercession that the charter was<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page035">[pg 035]</span><a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc26" id="toc26"></a>
granted at all, and, in this belief, the mayor and
aldermen were long accustomed to pay a solemn
visit to the bishop's tomb in St. Paul's church, there
to hear a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De profundis</span></span> on the day when the new
mayor took his oath of office before the Barons of the
Exchequer.<a id="noteref_83" name="noteref_83" href="#note_83"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">83</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As regards the port-reeve—the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">port-gerefa</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>,

extent of his duties and authority, much uncertainty
exists. Whilst, in many respects, his position in a
borough was analogous no doubt to the shire-reeve or
sheriff of a county, there were, on the other hand,
duties belonging to and exercised by the one which
were not exercised by the other. Thus, for instance,
the port-reeve, unlike the sheriff, exercised no judicial
functions in a criminal court, nor presided over court-leets
in the city as the sheriff did in his county by
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">turn</span></span>, the latter being held independently by the
alderman of each ward.<a id="noteref_85" name="noteref_85" href="#note_85"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">85</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the next place the charter brings prominently
to our notice the fact that there was already existing
within the City's walls a strong Norman element,
existing side by side with the older English burgesses,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page036">[pg 036]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which the Conqueror did well not to ignore. The
descendants of the foreign merchants from France
and Normandy, for whose protection Ethelred had
legislated more than half a century before, had continued
to carry on their commercial intercourse with
the Londoners, and were looking forward to a freer
interchange of merchandise now that the two countries
were under one sovereign. Their expectation
was justified. No sooner had London submitted to
the Norman Conqueror than, we are told, "many of
the citizens of Rouen and Caen passed over thither,
preferring to be dwellers in that city, inasmuch as it
was fitter for their trading, and better stored with
the merchandise in which they were wont to
traffic."<a id="noteref_86" name="noteref_86" href="#note_86"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">86</span></span></a> But by far the most important clause in
the charter is that which places the citizens of London
in the same position respecting the law of the land as
they enjoyed in the days of their late king, Edward
the Confessor. Here there is distinct evidence that
the Conqueror had come "neither to destroy, nor to
found, but to continue."<a id="noteref_87" name="noteref_87" href="#note_87"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">87</span></span></a> The charter granted
nothing new; it only ratified and set the royal

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is recorded that William granted another
charter to the citizens of London, vesting in them the
City and Sheriffwick of London, and this charter the
citizens proffered as evidence of their rights over the
cloister and church of St. Martin le Grand, when those<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037">[pg 037]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc27" id="toc27"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The compact thus made between London and the
Conqueror was faithfully kept by both parties. Having
ascended the English throne by the aid of the citizens
of London, William, unlike many of his successors,
was careful not to infringe the terms of their charter,
whilst the citizens on the other hand continued loyal
to their accepted king, and lent him assistance to put
down insurgents in other parts of the kingdom. The
fortress which William erected within their city's
walls did not disturb their equanimity. It was sufficient
for them that, under the Conqueror's rule, the
country was once more peaceful, so peaceful that, according
to the chronicler, a young maiden could
travel the length of England without being injured
or robbed.<a id="noteref_90" name="noteref_90" href="#note_90"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">90</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The close of the reign of William the First witnessed
the completion of "Doomsday," or survey of
the kingdom, which he had ordered to be made for
fiscal purposes. For some reason not explained,
neither London nor Winchester—the two capitals, so to
speak, of the kingdom—were included in this survey.
It may be that the importance of these boroughs,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page038">[pg 038]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
their wealth and population, necessitated some special
method of procedure; but this does not account for
the omission of Northumberland, Cumberland, Westmorland,
and Durham, from the survey. We know
that Winchester was afterwards surveyed, but no
steps in the same direction were ever taken with respect
to London. The survey was not effected without
disturbances, owing to the inquisitorial power
vested in the commissioners appointed to carry it out.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A fire destroyed St. Paul's and the greater part
of the City. Maurice, Bishop of London, at once
set to work to rebuild the Cathedral on a larger and
more magnificent scale, erecting the edifice upon arches
in a manner little known in England at that time, but
long practised in France. The Norman Conquest was
already working for good. Not only the style of
architecture, but the very stone used in re-building St.
Paul's came from France, the famous quarries of Caen
being utilised for the purpose.<a id="noteref_93" name="noteref_93" href="#note_93"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">93</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was already in the city, one church built

setting churches and other buildings upon vaults was
to guard against fire. Whatever defence against fire
this method of building may have afforded, it was
certainly no defence against wind. In 1091, the roof
of St. Mary-le-Bow was clean blown off, huge baulks
of timber, 26 feet long, being driven into the ground
with such force that scarce 4 feet of them could
be seen.<a id="noteref_94" name="noteref_94" href="#note_94"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">94</span></span></a></p>

Nevertheless, he continued to secure that protection
for life and property which his father had so successfully
achieved, so that a man "who had confidence in

gold."<a id="noteref_95" name="noteref_95" href="#note_95"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">95</span></span></a> He also had an eye for the protection of

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 2nd August, 1100, the Red King met his
death suddenly in the New Forest, and the next day
was buried at Winchester. According to a previous
agreement, the crown should have immediately
devolved upon his brother Robert. Crowns, however,
were not to be thus disposed of; they fell only
to those ready and strong enough to seize them.
Robert was far away on a crusade. His younger
brother Henry was on the spot, and upon him fell the
choice of such of the witan as happened to be in or
near Winchester at the time of the late king's death.<a id="noteref_97" name="noteref_97" href="#note_97"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">97</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The two days that elapsed before his coronation
at Westminster (5th August), the king-elect spent in
London, where by his easy and eloquent manner, as
well as by fair promises, he succeeded in winning the
inhabitants over to his cause, to the rejection of the
claims of Robert. The election, or perhaps we should
rather say, the selection of Henry by the witan at
Winchester, was thus approved and confirmed by the
whole realm (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">regni universitas</span></span>), in the city of
London.</p>

have thought, soon after his accession, and by way of
recognition of the services they had rendered him

appoint from among themselves whom they would to
be sheriff over it; they were further to be allowed to
appoint their own justiciar to hold pleas of the
crown, and no other justiciar should exercise authority
over them; they were not to be forced to plead
without the city's walls; they were to be exempt
from scot and lot and of all payments in respect
of Danegelt and murder; they were to be allowed to
purge themselves after the English fashion of making
oath and not after the Norman fashion by wager of
battle; their goods were to be free of all manner of
customs, toll, passage and lestage; their husting court
might sit once a week; and lastly, they might resort
to "withernam" or reprisal in cases where their goods
had been unlawfully seized.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Touching the true import of this grant of Middlesex
to the citizens at a yearly rent, with the right of
appointing their own sheriff over it, no less than the
identity of the justiciar whom they were to be
allowed to choose for themselves for the purpose of
hearing pleas of the crown within the city, much
divergence of opinion exists. Some believe that
the government of the city was hereby separated
from that of the shire wherein it was situate, and that
the right of appointing their own justiciar which the
citizens obtained by this charter was the right of
electing a sheriff for the city of London in the place
of the non-elective ancient port-reeve. Others deny
that the charter introduced the shire organization into
the government of the city, and believe the justiciar and
sheriff to have been distinct officials.<a id="noteref_101" name="noteref_101" href="#note_101"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">101</span></span></a> The latter appear
to hold the more plausible view. Putting aside<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page042">[pg 042]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the so-called charter of William the First, granting to
the citizens in express terms <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">civitatem et vice-comitatum
Londoniæ</span></span>, as wanting in corroboration, a
solution of the difficulty may be found if we consider
(1) that the city received a shire organization and
became in itself to all intents and purposes a county
as soon as it came to be governed by a port-reeve, if
not as soon as an alderman had been set over it by
Alfred; (2) that the duties of the shrievalty in respect
of the county of the city of London were at this time
performed either by a port-reeve or by one or more
officers, known subsequently as sheriffs, and (3) that
for the right of executing these duties no rent or ferm
was ever demanded or paid.<a id="noteref_102" name="noteref_102" href="#note_102"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">102</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If this be a correct view of the matter, it would
appear that the effect of Henry's grant of Middlesex
to the citizens to farm, and of the appointment of a
sheriff over it of their own choice, was not so much
to render the city independent of the shire, as to
make the shire subject to the city. It must be borne
in mind that no sheriff (or sheriffs) has ever been
elected by the citizens for Middlesex alone, the
duties appertaining to the sheriff-wick of Middlesex
having always been performed by the sheriffs of the
city for the time being.<a id="noteref_103" name="noteref_103" href="#note_103"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">103</span></span></a> Hence it is that the shrievalty

duties of both shrievalties) and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">firma</span></span> of £300

described as the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">firma</span></span> of "London," sometimes

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The right of electing their own justiciar granted
to the citizens by Henry resolves itself into little more
than a confirmation of the right to elect their own
sheriffs.<a id="noteref_105" name="noteref_105" href="#note_105"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">105</span></span></a> Just as sheriffs are known to have held pleas
of the crown in the counties up to the time of the
Great Charter (although their duties were modified by
Henry I, and again by Henry II, when he appointed
Justices in eyre) so in the city of London, no one,
except the sheriffs of London could hold pleas of the
crown, and an attempt made by the Barons in 1258
to introduce a justiciar into the Guildhall was persistently
challenged by the citizens.<a id="noteref_106" name="noteref_106" href="#note_106"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">106</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Even those who stedfastly maintain that in the

office of justiciar in the city was twice granted <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">eo

it is twice mentioned as having been held by one
named Gervase, who (there is reason to believe) is
identical with Gervase de Cornhill, a Sheriff of London

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The events which followed Henry's decease
afford us another instance of the futility of all attempts
at this early period to settle the succession to the
crown before the throne was actually vacant. The
King's nephew, Stephen of Blois, and the nobility of
England had sworn to accept the King's daughter
Matilda, wife of Geoffery of Anjou, as their sovereign
on the death of her father; yet when that event took
place in 1135, Stephen, in spite of his oath, claimed
the crown as nearest male heir of the Conqueror's
blood.<a id="noteref_108" name="noteref_108" href="#note_108"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">108</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was no doubt of his popularity, whilst
Matilda on the other hand injured her cause by
marrying an Angevin. On the continent a bitter feud
existed between Norman and Angevin; in England
the Norman had steadily increased in favour, and
England's crown was Stephen's if he had courage
enough to seize it.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Landing on the Kentish coast, his first reception
was far from encouraging. Canterbury and Dover, held
by the Earl of Gloucester, refused to acknowledge<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page045">[pg 045]</span><a name="Pg045" id="Pg045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc31" id="toc31"></a>
him and closed their gates on his approach. Undismayed
by these rebuffs, Stephen pushed on to London,
where he was welcomed by every token of good will.
The Londoners had been no party to the agreement
to recognise Matilda as Henry's successor; they had
become accustomed to exercising a right of sharing
in the choice of a king who should reign over them,
and they now chose Stephen. "It was their right,
their special privilege," said they, "on the occasion of
the king's decease, to provide another in his place."<a id="noteref_109" name="noteref_109" href="#note_109"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">109</span></span></a>
There was no time to be lost, the country was in
danger, Stephen was at hand, sent to them, as they
believed, by the goodness of Providence. They could
not do better than elect him: and elected he was
by the assembled aldermen or eldermen (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">majores
natu</span></span>) of the City.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such is the story of Stephen's election as given
by the author of the "Gesta Stephani," one who
wrote as an eye-witness of what took place, but
whose statements cannot always be taken as those of
an independent chronicler of events. Informal as this
election may have been, it marks an important epoch

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From London Stephen went down to Winchester,

recently appointed papal legate. Next to London, it
was important that Stephen should secure Winchester,
and now that London had spoken, the citizens of
Winchester no longer hesitated to throw in their lot
with the king. Winchester secured, and Stephen put
in possession of the royal castle and treasury, he
returned to London, where all doubts as to the
validity or invalidity of his election were set at rest
by the ceremony of coronation (Dec. 1135).</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the spring of the following year (April 1136),
a brilliant council of the clergy and magnates of the
realm was held in London,<a id="noteref_111" name="noteref_111" href="#note_111"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">111</span></span></a> reminding one of the
Easter courts of the days of the Conqueror which
latterly had been shorn of much of their splendour.
The occasion was one for introducing the new king to
his subjects as well as for confirming the liberties of
the church, and Stephen may have taken special care
to surround it with exceptional splendour as a set off
against the meagreness which had characterised the
recent ceremony of his coronation.<a id="noteref_112" name="noteref_112" href="#note_112"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">112</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meanwhile the injured Matilda appealed
to Rome, but only with the result that her rival
received formal recognition from the Pope. Three
years later (1139) she landed in England accompanied
by her brother, the Earl of Gloucester. She soon
obtained a following, more especially in the west; and
Winchester—the seat of the royal residence of the
queens of England since the time when Ethelred
presented the city as a "morning gift" to his consort at
their marriage—became her headquarters and rallying<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page047">[pg 047]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc32" id="toc32"></a>

marches and counter marches, in which neither party
could claim any decided success, Stephen, as was his
wont, withdrew to London and shut himself up in the
Tower, with only a single bishop, and he a foreigner,
in his train. Whilst safe behind the walls of that
stronghold, negotiations were opened between him and
the empress for a peaceful settlement of their respective
claims (May, 1140), Henry of Winchester
acting as intermediary between the rival parties.<a id="noteref_113" name="noteref_113" href="#note_113"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">113</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Matters assumed an entirely different aspect when
Stephen was made prisoner at Lincoln in the following
year (2nd Feb., 1141). Henry of Winchester forsook
his rôle of arbitrator, and entered into a formal
compact with the empress who arrived before Winchester
with the laurels of her recent success yet
fresh, agreeing to receive her as "Lady of England,"
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Domina Angliæ</span></span>) and promising her the allegiance of

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This compact was entered into on the 2nd March,
and on the following day the empress was received
with solemn pomp into Winchester Cathedral. It
remained for the compact to be ratified. For this
purpose an ecclesiastical synod was summoned to sit
at Winchester on the 7th April. The day was spent
by the legate holding informal communications with
the bishops, abbots, and archdeacons who were in
attendance, and who then for the first time in England's
history claimed the right not only of consecration,
but of election of the sovereign.<a id="noteref_115" name="noteref_115" href="#note_115"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">115</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 8th April, Henry in a long speech announced
to the assembled clergy the result of the conclave of
the previous day. He extolled the good government
of the late king who before his death had caused fealty
to be sworn to his daughter, the empress. The delay
of the empress in coming to England (he said) had
been the cause of Stephen's election. The latter had
forfeited all claim to the crown by his bad government,
and God's judgment had been pronounced against him.
Lest therefore, the nation should suffer for want of a
sovereign, he, as legate, had summoned them together,
and by them the empress had been elected Lady of
England. The speech was received with unanimous
applause, those to whom the election did not commend
itself being wise enough to hold their tongue.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But there was another element to be considered
before Matilda's new title could be assured. What

setting Stephen on the throne, and still owed to them<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page049">[pg 049]</span><a name="Pg049" id="Pg049" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc33" id="toc33"></a>
their allegiance, say to it? The legate had foreseen the
difficulty that might arise if the citizens, whom he
described as very princes of the realm, by reason of the
greatness of their city (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">qui sunt quasi optimates pro
magnitudine civitatis in Anglia</span></span>), could not be won
over. He had, therefore, sent a special safe conduct
for their attendance, so he informed the meeting after
the applause which followed his speech had died away,
and he expected them to arrive on the following day.
If they pleased they would adjourn till then.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next day (9th April) the Londoners arrived,
as the legate had foretold, and were ushered before
the council. They had been sent, they said, by the so
called "commune" of London; and their purpose was
not to enter into debate, but only to beg for the release
of their lord, the king.<a id="noteref_116" name="noteref_116" href="#note_116"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">116</span></span></a> The statement was supported

the archbishop and all the clergy in attendance.
Their solicitations, however, proved of no avail. The
legate replied with the same arguments he had
used the day before, adding that it ill became
the Londoners who were regarded as nobles
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quasi proceres</span></span>) in the land to foster those who
had basely deserted their king on the field of battle,
and who only curried favour with the citizens in order
to fleece them of their money.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here an interruption took place. A messenger
presented to the legate a paper from Stephen's queen
to read to the council. Henry took the paper, and
after scanning its contents, refused to communicate
them to the meeting. The messenger, however, not
to be thus foiled, himself made known the contents of
the paper. These were, in effect, an exhortation by the
queen to the clergy, and more especially to the legate
himself, to restore Stephen to liberty. The legate,
however, returned the same answer as before, and the
meeting broke up, the Londoners promising to communicate
the decision of the council to their brethren
at home, and to do their best to obtain their support.</p>

her admission into the city, the inhabitants of which,
had as yet shown but little disposition towards her.
But however great their inclination may have been to
Stephen, they at length found themselves forced to
transfer their allegiance and to offer, for a time at
least, a politic submission to the empress. Accordingly,
a deputation went out to meet her at St. Albans
(May 1141), and arrange terms on which the city
should surrender.<a id="noteref_118" name="noteref_118" href="#note_118"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">118</span></span></a></p>

expectation that the fortress over which Geoffrey
was governor, would be held secure for the royal
cause. The newly fledged earl, however, was one
who ever fought for his own hand, and was ready to
sell his fortress and sword to the highest bidder. The
few days that the empress was in the city, afforded
her an opportunity of risking a trial to win over the
earl from his allegiance. To this end she offered to
confirm him in his earldom and to continue him in his
office of Constable of the Tower, conferred upon him<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page052">[pg 052]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by Stephen; in addition to which, she was ready to
allow him to enjoy lands of the rent of £100 a year,
a license to fortify his castles, and the posts of sheriff
and justiciar throughout his earldom. The bait was
too tempting for the earl not to accept; and a charter
to the above effect was drawn up and executed.<a id="noteref_124" name="noteref_124" href="#note_124"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">124</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But even these great concessions failed to secure

from his allegiance and planned a revolt in favour of
the empress who recompensed him with still greater
dignities and possessions than any yet bestowed.
This second charter of the empress,<a id="noteref_130" name="noteref_130" href="#note_130"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">130</span></span></a> is remarkable for

throughout the long period of civil dissension, were
generally to be found on the winning side, and held as

managed after considerable bloodshed to capture

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Both London and Winchester had been laid in
ashes during Stephen's reign, the former by a conflagration—which
took place in 1136, again destroying
St. Paul's and extending from London Bridge to the
church of St. Clement Danes—the latter by the
burning missiles used in the conflict between Stephen
and the empress in 1141. Winchester never recovered
her position, and London was left without a rival.
Fitz-Stephen, who wrote an account of the city as it
stood in the reign of Henry II, describes it as holding
its head higher than all others; its fame was wider
known; its wealth and merchandise extended further
than any other; it was the capital of the kingdom
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">regni Anglorum sedes</span></span>).<a id="noteref_135" name="noteref_135" href="#note_135"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">135</span></span></a></p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">Thomas of London.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was through the mediation of an intimate
friend and fellow citizen of Fitz-Stephen that Archbishop
Theobald had invited Henry of Anjou over
from France in 1153. Thomas of London, better
known as Thomas Becket, although of foreign descent,
was born in the heart of the city, having first seen the
light in the house of Gilbert, his father, some time
Portreeve of London, situate in Cheapside on a site
now occupied by the hall and chapel of the Mercers'
Chapel. Having been ordained a deacon of the
Church, he became in course of time clerk or chaplain<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page056">[pg 056]</span><a name="Pg056" id="Pg056" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to the archbishop. Vigorous and active as he was,
Thomas soon made his influence felt, and it was owing
to his suggestion (so it is said<a id="noteref_136" name="noteref_136" href="#note_136"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">136</span></span></a>) that the bishops had
declined to be a party to the coronation of Eustace
during Stephen's lifetime.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the accession of Henry, Thomas passed from
the service of the archbishop, then advanced in years,
to the service of the young king. He was raised to
the dignity of chancellor, and became one of the
king's most trusted advisers. By their united efforts
order was once again restored throughout the kingdom.
The great barons, who had established themselves
in castles erected without royal licence, were
brought into subjection to the crown and compelled
to pull down their walls. Upon the death of the
archbishop, Thomas was appointed to the vacant See
(1162). From that day forward the friendship between
king and archbishop began to wane. Henry found
that all his attempts to establish order in his kingdom
were thwarted by exemptions claimed by the archbishop
on behalf of the clergy. He found that
allegiance to the Crown was divided with allegiance
to the Pope, and this state of things was likely to
continue so long as the archbishop lived. Becket's
end is familiar to us all. His memory was long
cherished by the citizens of London, who made many
a pilgrimage to the scene of his martyrdom and left
many an offering on his tomb in the cathedral of
Canterbury. It is hard to say for which of the two,
the father or the son, the citizens entertained the
greater reverence. For many years after his death it
was the custom for the Mayor of the City for the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page057">[pg 057]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc39" id="toc39"></a>
time being, upon entering into office, to meet the
aldermen at the church of St. Thomas of Acon—a
church which had been erected and endowed in
honour of the murdered archbishop by his sister
Agnes, wife of Thomas Fitz-Theobald of Helles<a id="noteref_137" name="noteref_137" href="#note_137"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">137</span></span></a>—and
thence to proceed to the tomb of Gilbert
Becket, the father, in St. Paul's churchyard, there to
say a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De profundis</span></span>; after which both mayor and
aldermen returned to the church of St. Thomas, and,
each having made an offering of two pence, returned
to his own home.<a id="noteref_138" name="noteref_138" href="#note_138"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">138</span></span></a> St. Thomas's Hospital, in Southwark,
was originally dedicated to the murdered
archbishop, but after its dissolution and subsequent
restoration as one of the Royal Hospitals, its patron
saint was no longer Thomas the Martyr, but Thomas
the Apostle.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whilst the king and his chancellor were busy
settling the kingdom, establishing a uniform administration
of justice and system of revenue, and not only
renewing but extending the form of government which
had been instituted by Henry I, the citizens of London,
availing themselves of the security afforded by a strong
government, redoubled their energy in following commercial
pursuits and succeeded in raising the city, as
Fitz-Stephen has told us, to a pitch of prosperity far
exceeding that of any other city in the world.</p>

of a more limited character than that granted to
them by his grandfather. The later charter, for
instance, although in the main lines following the
older charter, makes no mention of Middlesex being
let to ferm nor of any appointment of sheriff or justiciar
being vested in the citizens. It appears as if
Henry was determined to bring the citizens no less
than the barons of the realm within more direct and
immediate subservience to the crown. The concession
made by the king's grandfather had been ignored by
Stephen and the empress Matilda, each of whom in
turn had granted the shrievalty of London and Middlesex
to the Earl of Essex. For a time the appointment
of sheriffs was lost to the citizens. Throughout
the reigns of Henry II and his successor they were
appointed by the crown. Richard's charter to the
citizens makes no mention of the sheriffwick, nor
is it mentioned in the first charter granted by John.
When it was restored to the citizens (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 1199), by
John's second charter, the office of sheriff of London
had lost much of its importance owing to the introduction
of the communal system of municipal government
under a mayor.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime the sheriffs of the counties, who
had by reason of Henry's administrative reforms, risen
to be officers of greater importance and wider jurisdiction,
and who had taken advantage of their positions to
oppress the people during the king's prolonged absence
abroad, were also made to feel the power of the crown.
A blow struck at the sheriffs was calculated to weaken<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page059">[pg 059]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc40" id="toc40"></a>
the nobility and the larger landowners—the class from
which it had been the custom hitherto to select these
officers. Henry saw the advantage to be gained, and
on his return to England in 1170 deposed most of the
sheriffs and ordered a strict enquiry to be made, as to
the extortions they had committed in his absence.
Their places were filled for the most part by men of
lower rank, and therefore likely to be more submissive.
Some, however, were reinstated and became more cruel
and extortionate than ever.<a id="noteref_140" name="noteref_140" href="#note_140"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">140</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The last fifteen years of Henry's life were full of
domestic trouble. He had always found it an easier
matter to rule his kingdom than his household. His
sons were for ever thwarting his will and quarrelling
with each other. It was his desire to secure the
succession to the crown for his eldest son Henry, and
to this end he had caused him to be crowned by the
Archbishop of York (14th June, 1170), who was
thereupon declared excommunicated by his brother
of Canterbury. The son began to clamour for his
inheritance whilst his father still lived, and appealed
in 1173 to the French king, whose daughter he had
married, to assist him in his unholy enterprise. Whilst
Henry was engaged in defending his crown against
his own son on the continent, the great barons of
England rose in insurrection, and the king was obliged
to hasten home, where he arrived in July, 1174. The
rebellion was quickly put down, and the strife between
king and nobles for a time ceased.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the city there were occasional disturbances
caused by the younger nobility—the young bloods of<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page060">[pg 060]</span><a name="Pg060" id="Pg060" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

into the houses of the rich and committed every
kind of excess. In 1177 the brother of the Earl
of Ferrers was waylaid and killed, and for some time
the streets were unsafe at night. The chronicler records
a singular outrage perpetrated three years before, by
these sprigs of nobility. They forcibly entered the
house of a wealthy citizen whose name has not come
down to us, he is simply styled the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pater-familias</span></span>.
Of his courage we are left in no doubt, for we are
told that he slipt on a coat of mail, armed his house-hold,
and awaited the attack. He had not long to
wait. The leader of the band—one Andrew Bucquinte
soon made his appearance, and was met by
a pan of hot coals. Swords were drawn on both
sides and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pater-familias</span></span>, whose coat of mail served
him well, succeeded in cutting off the right hand of
his assailant. Upon the cry of thieves being raised,
the delinquents took to their heels, leaving their
leader a prisoner.  The next day, being brought
before the king's justiciar, he informed against his
companions. This cowardly action on the part of
Bucquinte led to many of them being taken, and
among them one who is described by the chronicler
as the noblest and wealthiest of London citizens, but
to whom the chronicler gives no other name than
"John, the old man" (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Johannes Senex</span></span>). An offer was
made to John to prove his innocence by what was
known as the ordeal by water,<a id="noteref_142" name="noteref_142" href="#note_142"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">142</span></span></a> but the offer was<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page061">[pg 061]</span><a name="Pg061" id="Pg061" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc41" id="toc41"></a>
declined, and he was eventually hanged. The whole
story looks suspicious.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having settled the succession of the crown of
England upon his eldest son, the king put his second
son, Richard, into possession of the Duchy of Aquitaine,
and provided for his third son, Geoffrey, by
marriage with the heiress of Brittany. There was
yet another son, John, who was too young to be provided
for just now, and who being without any territory,
assigned to him, acquired the name of Lackland.
Both Richard and Geoffrey had taken the part of their
brother Henry in 1173, and in 1177 the three brothers
were again quarrelling with their father and with each
other. After the deaths of Henry and Geoffrey, the
quarrel was taken up by the surviving brothers,
Richard and John.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In all these—more or less—petty wars with his
sons, the king had always to deal with the ruler of
France. At last, in 1189, the loss of Le Mans—his
own birth-place—and the unexpected discovery that
his youngest and best beloved son, John, had turned
traitor towards him, left the king nothing to live for,
and after a few days suffering he died, ill and worn
out, at Chinon.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Richard had scarcely succeeded to the throne,

supreme control of affairs into his own hands, and
commenced to act in the most tyrannical fashion. He
increased the security of the Tower of London, which
had been committed to his charge, by surrounding it
with a moat,<a id="noteref_144" name="noteref_144" href="#note_144"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">144</span></span></a> and having got himself nominated papal

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Report of the Chancellor's conduct having reached
the ears of Richard, he despatched the Archbishop
of Rouen to England with a new commission, but
the worthy prelate on arrival (April, 1191), was afraid
to present the commission, preferring to let matters
take their course.<a id="noteref_146" name="noteref_146" href="#note_146"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">146</span></span></a> Already a fierce rivalry had
sprung up between the chancellor and John, the
king's brother, who, for purposes of his own, had espoused
the cause of the oppressed. Popular feeling
at length became so strong, that Longchamp feared
to meet John and the bishops, and, instead of going
to Reading, where his attendance was required, he
hastened to London. Arriving there (7 Oct.), he
called the citizens together in the Guildhall, and prayed
them to uphold the King against John, whom he denounced
as aiming plainly at the Crown. The leading
men in the city at the time were Richard Fitz-Reiner
and Henry de Cornhill. These took opposite sides,
the former favouring John, whilst the latter took the
side of the chancellor.<a id="noteref_147" name="noteref_147" href="#note_147"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">147</span></span></a> John's party proving the

varies in some particulars, but the main features are
the same in all. The king's minister was set aside,
John was recognised as the head of the kingdom,
and new appointments made to judicial,
fiscal, and military offices. The Archbishop of
Rouen, who attended the council, seeing the turn
affairs had taken, no longer hesitated to produce the
letters under the king's sign manual appointing a new
commission for the government of the kingdom.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same day that witnessed the fall of Longchamp
was also a memorable one in the annals of the
City of London; for immediately after judgment had
been passed on the chancellor, John and the assembled
barons granted to the citizens "their commune,"
swearing to preserve untouched the dignities of the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is the first public recognition of the citizens
of London as a body corporate; but so far from
granting to them something new, the very words
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">their</span></span> commune (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">communam suam</span></span>) imply a commune

in existence, unauthorised by the crown, cannot be
determined; but that the term <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">communio</span></span> in connection

to translate <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">communio</span></span> as "commune," the latter being
essentially a French term for a particular form of
municipal government. He prefers to render it "commonalty,"
"fraternity," or "franchise," although he
goes so far as to allow that the term "suggests
that the communal idea was already in existence as
a basis of civic organization" in Stephen's reign, an
idea which became fully developed in the succeeding<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page065">[pg 065]</span><a name="Pg065" id="Pg065" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc43" id="toc43"></a>

Richard of Devizes, who distinctly states that the

and that it was of such a character that neither
King Richard nor Henry his father would have conceded
it for a million marks of silver, and that a

that of a French <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">commune</span></span>, whenever that happened
to take place, there took place also a change in the
chief governor of the city. The head of the city was
no longer a Saxon "port-reeve" but a French "mayor,"
the former officer continuing in all probability to perform
the duties of a port-reeve or sheriff of a town
in a modified form. From the time when this "civic

a change in the name of the chief magistrate of the
City of London took place at the accession of
Richard I. What gave rise to this belief is hard to
say, but it is not improbable that it arose from a statement
to be found in an early manuscript record still
preserved among the archives of the Corporation, and
known as the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Liber de Antiquis Legibus</span></span>.<a id="noteref_159" name="noteref_159" href="#note_159"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">159</span></span></a> The

party and his followers, had "intended to slay"
on the very day that news reached London of the
battle of Evesham, which crushed the hopes of Montfort
and his supporters. The date of his death cannot
be precisely determined, but there can be but little
doubt that it took place early in the third year of
the reign of Edward the First, inasmuch as his
will was proved and enrolled in the Court of
Husting, London, held on Monday, the morrow of
the Feast of St. Scolastica [10 Feb.] of that year

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In order to wipe out the stain of his imprisonment,
he thought fit to go through the ceremony of coronation
for the second time. His first coronation had
taken place at Westminster (3 Sept., 1189,) soon after
his accession, and the citizens of London had duly
performed a service at the coronation banquet—a
service which even in those days was recognised as an
"ancient service"—namely, that of assisting the chief
butler, for which the mayor was customarily presented
with a gold cup and ewer. The citizens of the rival
city of Winchester performed on this occasion the
lesser service of attending to the viands.<a id="noteref_169" name="noteref_169" href="#note_169"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">169</span></span></a></p>

exacted under Henry II, mainly through the interposition
of Thomas of London, was practically
revived under a new name. The charter already
mentioned as having been granted to the citizens by
Richard after his return from captivity was probably
purchased, for one of the king's regular methods of
raising money was a lavish distribution of charters to
boroughs, not from any love he had for municipal
government, but in order to put money in his purse.
As soon as Richard had collected all the money he
could raise in England, he again left the country,
never to return.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The pressure of taxation weighed heavily on the
poor, and occasioned a rising in the city under the
leadership of William Fitz-Osbert. The cry was that
the rich were spared whilst the poor were called upon
to pay everything.<a id="noteref_172" name="noteref_172" href="#note_172"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">172</span></span></a> Accounts of the commotion differ
according as the writer favoured the autocratic or
democratic side. One chronicler, for instance, finds
fault with Fitz-Osbert's personal appearance, imputing
his inordinate length of beard—he was known as
"Longbeard"—to his desire for conspicuousness,
and declares him to have been actuated by base
motives.<a id="noteref_173" name="noteref_173" href="#note_173"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">173</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Others describe him as a wealthy citizen of the

may have been the true character of the man and the
real motive of his action, it is certain that he had a
large following. When Hubert Walter, the justiciar,
sent to arrest him, "Longbeard" took refuge in the
church of St. Mary-le-Bow. Thither he was followed
by the king's officers—described by a not impartial
chronicler as men devoid of truth and piety and
enemies of the poor.<a id="noteref_175" name="noteref_175" href="#note_175"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">175</span></span></a>—who with the aid of fire

with the view of aiding commerce, caused the wears
in the Thames to be removed, and forbade his wardens

been accustomed. The writ to this effect was dated
from the Island of Andely or Les Andelys on the
Seine, the 14th July, 1197, in the neighbourhood of
that fortress which Richard had erected, and of
which he was so proud—the Château Gaillard

which the castle enjoyed for impregnability<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page072">[pg 072]</span><a name="Pg072" id="Pg072" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Soon after John's accession we find what appears
to be the first mention of a court of aldermen as a
deliberative body. In the year 1200, writes Thedmar
(himself an alderman), "were chosen five and twenty
of the more discreet men of the city, and sworn to
take counsel on behalf of the city, together with
the mayor."<a id="noteref_178" name="noteref_178" href="#note_178"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">178</span></span></a> Just as in the constitution of the realm,

of a court of aldermen preceded that of the common

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When, after thirteen years of misgovernment,
during which John had enraged the barons and
excited general discontent by endless impositions,
matters were brought to a climax by his submission
to the pope, it was in the city of London that the
first steps were taken by his subjects to recover their
lost liberty. On the 25th August, 1213, a meeting of
the clergy and barons was held in the church of
St. Paul; a memorable meeting, and one that has
been described as "a true parliament of the realm,
though no king presided in it."<a id="noteref_179" name="noteref_179" href="#note_179"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">179</span></span></a> Stephen Langton,
whose appointment as Archbishop of Canterbury
had so raised John's ire, took the lead and produced
to the assembly a copy of the Charter of Liberties,
granted by Henry I, when that king undertook to
put an end to the tyranny of William Rufus. If
the barons so pleased, it might (he said) serve as a<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page073">[pg 073]</span><a name="Pg073" id="Pg073" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc47" id="toc47"></a>
precedent. The charter having been then and there
deliberately read, the barons unanimously declared
that for such liberties they were ready to fight, and,
if necessary, to die.<a id="noteref_180" name="noteref_180" href="#note_180"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">180</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The clergy and people who had hitherto supported
the king against the barons, having now engaged themselves
to assist the barons against the tyranny of the
king, John found himself with but one friend in the
world, and that was the Pope. "Innocent's view of
the situation was very simple," writes Dr. Gardiner,
"John was to obey the Pope, and all John's subjects
were to obey John." Within a few weeks of the
council being held at St. Paul's, the same sacred
edifice witnessed the formality of affixing a golden <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">bulla</span></span>
to the deed—the detestable deed (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">carta detestabilis</span></span>)—whereby
John had in May last resigned the crown
of England to the papal legate, and received it again
as the Pope's feudatory.<a id="noteref_181" name="noteref_181" href="#note_181"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">181</span></span></a></p>

then known as the "New" Temple. The result,
however, was unsatisfactory, and both parties prepared
for an appeal to force, the barons choosing as their
leader Robert Fitz-Walter, whom they dubbed
"Marshal of the army of God and of Holy Church."<a id="noteref_184" name="noteref_184" href="#note_184"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">184</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This Fitz-Walter was Baron of Dunmow in Essex,
the owner of Baynard's Castle in the City of London,
and lord of a soke, which embraced the whole of the
parish known as St. Andrew Castle Baynard. He
moreover enjoyed the dignity of castellain and chief
bannerer or banneret of London. The rights and
privileges attaching to his soke and to his official
position in time of peace were considerable, to judge
from a claim to them put forward by his grandson
in the year 1303. Upon making his appearance in
the Court of Husting at the Guildhall, it was the
duty of the Mayor, or other official holding the court,
to rise and meet him and place him by his side.
Again, if any traitor were taken within his soke or
jurisdiction, it was his right to sentence him to death,
the manner of death being that the convicted person
should be tied to a post in the Thames at the Wood
Wharf, and remain there during two tides and two
ebbs.<a id="noteref_185" name="noteref_185" href="#note_185"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">185</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In later years, however, upon an enquiry being

all rights attaching to the castle and barony, although
he very considerately declared his willingness to forego

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it was in time of war that Fitz-Walter
achieved for himself the greatest power and dignity.
It then became the duty of the castellain to proceed
to the great gate of St. Paul's attended by nineteen
other knights, mounted and caparisoned, and having
his banner, emblazoned with his arms, displayed before
him. Immediately upon his arrival, the mayor, aldermen,
and sheriffs, who awaited him, issued solemnly
forth from the church, all arrayed in arms, the
mayor bearing in his hand the city banner, the
ground of which was bright vermilion or gules, with
a figure of St. Paul, in gold, thereon, the head, feet,
and hands of the saint being silver or argent, and
in his right hand a sword.<a id="noteref_187" name="noteref_187" href="#note_187"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">187</span></span></a> The castellain, advancing
to meet the mayor, informed him that he had
come to do the service which the city had a right
to demand at his hands, and thereupon the mayor
placed the city's banner in his hands, and then, attending
him back to the gate, presented him with a charger of
the value of £20, its saddle emblazoned with the
arms of Fitz-Walter, and its housing of cendal or silk,
similarly enriched.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A sum of £20 was at the same time handed to
Fitz-Walter's chamberlain to defray the day's expenses.<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page076">[pg 076]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Having mounted his charger, he bids the Mayor to
choose a Marshal of the host of the City of London;
and this being done, the communal or "mote-bell" is
set ringing, and the whole party proceed to the Priory
of Holy Trinity at Aldgate. There they dismount,
and entering the Priory, concert measures together for
the defence of the city. There is one other point
worthy of remark, touching the office of chief banneret,
and that is that on the occasion of any siege
undertaken by the London forces, the castellain was
to receive as his fee the niggardly sum of one hundred
shillings for his trouble, and no more.</p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">Feud between Fitz-Walter and King John.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not improbable that Fitz-Walter's election
as leader of the remonstrant barons was in some
measure due to his official position in the city. It is
also probable, as Mr. Riley has pointed out, that the
unopposed admission of the barons into the city, on
the 24th May, 1215, may have been facilitated by
Fitz-Walter's connexion, as castellain, with the Priory
of Holy Trinity, situate in the vicinity.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But there were other reasons for selecting Fitz-Walter
as their leader at this juncture. If the story
be true, Fitz-Walter had good reason to be bitterly
hostile to King John, for having caused his fair
daughter Maude or Matilda to be poisoned, after
having unsuccessfully made an attempt upon her
chastity.<a id="noteref_188" name="noteref_188" href="#note_188"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">188</span></span></a> This is not the only crime of the kind laid

be too much reason for believing most of the charges<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page077">[pg 077]</span><a name="Pg077" id="Pg077" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc49" id="toc49"></a>
against him to be true. It is certain that Fitz-Walter
was one of the first to entertain designs against John,
and that he and Eustace de Vesci, on whose family
the king is said to have put a similar affront, were
forced to escape to France. The story how Fitz-Walter
attracted John's notice by his prowess at a tournament
in which he was engaged on the side of the French,
and was restored to the King's favour and his own
estates, is familiar to all.</p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">The Barons admitted into the City, May, 1215.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After a feeble attempt to capture Northampton,
the barons, with Fitz-Walter at their head, accepted
an invitation from the citizens of London to enter the
city. They made their entry through Aldgate.<a id="noteref_190" name="noteref_190" href="#note_190"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">190</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The concession which John had recently made to
the citizens, viz.:—the right of annually electing their
own mayor<a id="noteref_191" name="noteref_191" href="#note_191"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">191</span></span></a>—had failed to secure their allegiance.
The city became thenceforth the headquarters of the
barons,<a id="noteref_192" name="noteref_192" href="#note_192"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">192</span></span></a> and the adhesion of the Londoners was
followed by so great a defection from the King's party
(including among others that of Henry de Cornhill),
that he was left without any power of resistance.<a id="noteref_193" name="noteref_193" href="#note_193"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">193</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The citizens met their reward for fidelity to the
barons when John was brought to bay at Runnymede.
In drafting the articles of the Great Charter the barons,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By way of further security for the fulfilment of
the articles of the charter the barons demanded and
obtained the custody of the City of London, including
the Tower, and they reserved to themselves the right

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The right of resistance thus established was soon
to be carried into execution. Before the year was
out, John had broken faith, and was besieging Rochester
with the aid of mercenaries. An attempt to raise
the siege failed, owing to the timidity (not to say
cowardice) of Fitz-Walter, who, like the rest of the

but to invite Louis the Dauphin to come and undertake
the government of the kingdom in the place of
John. On the 21st May, 1216, Louis landed at
Sandwich and came to London, where he was welcomed
by the barons. Both barons and citizens paid
him homage, whilst he, on his part, swore to restore
to them their rights, to maintain such laws of the
realm as were good, and to abolish those (if any)
that were bad.<a id="noteref_198" name="noteref_198" href="#note_198"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">198</span></span></a> Suspicion, however, had been aroused

Robert Fitz-Walter, and a neighbour of his in the

like Fitz-Walter, had also suffered banishment in 1213.
The tower or castle of Muntfichet lay a little to the
west of Baynard's Castle, and was made over in 1276
by Gregory de Rokesle, the mayor, and citizens of
London to the Archbishop of Canterbury, for the

being thus amicably settled, Louis went to London,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page082">[pg 082]</span><a name="Pg082" id="Pg082" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For some years to come there remained a party in
the city who cherished the memory of Louis, and the
cry of "Mountjoy!" the war-cry of the French king—was
sufficient to cause a riot as late as 1222, when
Constantine Fitz-Athulf or Olaf, an ex-sheriff of
London, raised the cry at a tournament, in order to
test the feeling of the populace towards Louis. Any
serious results that might have arisen were promptly
prevented by Hubert de Burgh, the justiciar, who very
quickly sought out the ringleader, and incontinently
caused him and two of his followers to be hanged at
the Elms in Smithfield. Whilst the halter was round
his neck, Fitz-Athulf offered 15,000 marks of silver for
his life. The offer was declined. He was not to be
allowed another chance of stirring up sedition in the
city.<a id="noteref_210" name="noteref_210" href="#note_210"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">210</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A more circumstantial account of this event is
given us by another chronicler,<a id="noteref_211" name="noteref_211" href="#note_211"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">211</span></span></a> who relates that the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page083">[pg 083]</span><a name="Pg083" id="Pg083" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc54" id="toc54"></a>
wrestling match which took place on the festival of
Saint James (25th July),—the same as that mentioned
by Matthew Paris—was held at Queen Matilda's
hospital in the suburbs,<a id="noteref_212" name="noteref_212" href="#note_212"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">212</span></span></a> and was a match between
the citizens of London and those outside; that victory
declared itself in favour of the Londoners, and that their
opponents, and among them the steward of the Abbot
of Westminster, thereupon left in high dudgeon. With
thoughts of revenge in their hearts, the latter caused
invitations to be issued for another match to be held
at Westminster, on the following feast of Saint Peter
ad Vincula (1st August).</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was at this second and later match that the
trouble began. The steward was not content with
collecting the most powerful athletes he could find,
but caused them to seize weapons and to attack the
defenceless citizens who had come to take part in the
games. The Londoners hurried home, bleeding with
wounds, and immediately took counsel as to what
was best to be done. Serlo, the mercer, who had
held the office of mayor of the city for the past five
years, and was of a peaceable disposition, suggested
referring the matter to the abbot; and it was then that
Constantine, who had a large following, advocated an
attack upon the houses of the abbot and of his steward.
No sooner said than done, and many houses had already
suffered before the justiciar appeared upon the scene
with a large force. As to the seizure of Constantine
and his subsequent execution, the chroniclers agree.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Constantine's fellow citizens were very indignant
at the indecent haste with which the justiciar had<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page084">[pg 084]</span><a name="Pg084" id="Pg084" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
caused his execution to be carried out, and did not
fail to bring the matter up in judgment against him,
when, some ten years later, Hubert de Burgh himself
fell into disgrace.<a id="noteref_213" name="noteref_213" href="#note_213"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">213</span></span></a> The result was, that the
justiciar took refuge in the Priory of Merton. When
the citizens received the king's orders to follow
him there, and to take him dead or alive, they
obeyed with unconcealed joy. They allowed little
time to elapse, but set out at once, 20,000 strong,
ready to tear him limb from limb; but luckily they
were stopped in time by another message from the
king, and Hubert obtained a respite.<a id="noteref_214" name="noteref_214" href="#note_214"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">214</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the time of Constantine's execution, there was
real danger to be anticipated from raising the cry in
favour of any foreigner. The land was already
swarming with foreigners, and in that very year
(viz. 1222), the archbishop had been under the necessity
of summoning a council of bishops and nobles to
be held in London, owing to dissensions that had
arisen between the Earl of Chester, William of Salisbury,
the king's uncle, and Hubert de Burgh, and to a
rumour that had got abroad, that foreigners were
inciting the Earl of Chester to raise an insurrection.<a id="noteref_215" name="noteref_215" href="#note_215"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">215</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A few years later, the country was over-run by a

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Throughout the reign of Henry III, there was
one continuous struggle against foreign dominion,
either secular or ecclesiastical. In this struggle,
none took a more active part than the citizens of
London, and "when [in 1247], the nobles, clergy, and
people of England put forth their famous letter
denouncing the wrongs which England suffered at
the hands of the Roman bishop, it was with the seal
of the city of London, as the centre of national life
that the national protest was made."<a id="noteref_217" name="noteref_217" href="#note_217"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">217</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Side by side with this struggle another was being
carried on, a struggle for the liberty of the subject
against the tyranny and rapacity of the king. More
especially was this the case with the city. Henry
was for ever invading the rights and liberties of the
citizens. Thus in 1239, he insisted upon their admitting
to the shrievalty one who had already been
dismissed from that office for irregular conduct, and
because they refused to forego their chartered right of
election and to appoint the king's nominee, the city
was deprived of a mayor for three months and more.<a id="noteref_218" name="noteref_218" href="#note_218"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">218</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The substitution of a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">custos</span></span> or warden appointed
by the king for a mayor elected by the citizens, and
of bailiffs for sheriffs,—a procedure known as "taking

resorted to both by Henry and his successors, and
notably by Edward I, in whose reign the city was
deprived of its mayor, and remained under government
of a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">custos</span></span> for thirteen consecutive years
(1285-1298).<a id="noteref_219" name="noteref_219" href="#note_219"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">219</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Any pretext was sufficient for Henry's purpose.
If the citizens harboured a foreigner without warrant,
not only was the city taken into the king's hand, but
the citizens were fined £1,000,<a id="noteref_220" name="noteref_220" href="#note_220"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">220</span></span></a> a sum equal to at
least £20,000 at the present day. A widow brings an
action for a third part of her late husband's goods in
addition to her dower. The case goes against her in
the Court of Husting, and is heard on appeal before
the king's justiciar sitting at St. Martin's-le-Grand.
The verdict is not set aside, but some flaw is discovered
in the mode of procedure; the explanation
of the citizens is deemed insufficient, and the mayor
and sheriffs are forthwith deposed, to be reinstated
only on the understanding that they will so far forego
their chartered right—viz.: of not impleading nor being
impleaded without the walls of their city—as to consent
to attend the king's court at Westminster, where
finally, and after considerable delay, they are acquitted.<a id="noteref_221" name="noteref_221" href="#note_221"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">221</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Take another instance. The king had shown an
interest in the Abbey Church of Westminster, and
had caused a new chapel to be built in 1220, he himself
laying the first stone. Thirty years later, or
thereabouts, he made certain concessions to the Abbot
of Westminster—what they were we are not told—but
it is certain that they, in some way or other,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page087">[pg 087]</span><a name="Pg087" id="Pg087" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc56" id="toc56"></a>
infringed the rights of the citizens of London in the
County of Middlesex. The king promised to compensate
them for the loss they would sustain; but
failing to get their consent by fair promises, he
resorted to his favourite measure of taking the city
into his own hands. For fifteen years the dispute
between the citizens and the Abbot as to their
respective rights in the County of Middlesex was kept
alive, and was at last determined by a verdict given
by the barons of the exchequer, which completely
justified<a id="noteref_222" name="noteref_222" href="#note_222"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">222</span></span></a> the attitude taken up by the citizens of

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1230 he extorted a large sum of money from
the citizens at a time when he was meditating an
expedition to the continent for the purpose of
recovering lost possessions. The citizens, however,
were not the only sufferers. The religious houses
were heavily mulcted, as were also the Jews, who,
whether they would or not, were made to give up
one third of their chattels.<a id="noteref_223" name="noteref_223" href="#note_223"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">223</span></span></a> Again in 1244, the
citizens of London and the Jews were made to open
their purse-strings that the king might the better be

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Only once does it appear that the king's conscience
pricked him for the extortions he was continually

he called the citizens together at Westminster, and
begged their forgiveness for all trespasses, extortions
of goods and victuals under the name of "prises," and
for forced loans or talliages. Seeing no other way

honour to the king and queen as they passed on their

damped by the king refusing to allow Andrew Bukerel
the mayor to perform the customary service of
assisting the chief butler at the coronation banquet.
It was not a time for raising questions of etiquette, so
the mayor pocketed the affront, preferring to settle

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet, notwithstanding his manifestly unjust treatment
of the citizens of London, and the cynical
contempt with which he looked upon their ancient
claim to the title of "barons," he usually went through
the formality of taking leave of them at Paul's Cross<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page089">[pg 089]</span><a name="Pg089" id="Pg089" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc57" id="toc57"></a>

and was not above making use of them when compelled
to sell his plate and jewels to satisfy his debts. In
1252, he even went so far as to grant them a charter

pay 500 marks.<a id="noteref_230" name="noteref_230" href="#note_230"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">230</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is scarcely to be wondered at if, when the
crisis arrived, and king and barons found themselves
in avowed hostility, the citizens of London joined the
popular cause. By the month of June, 1258, the
barons had gained their first victory over Henry.
He was forced to accept the Provisions of Oxford,
passed by the Mad Parliament,<a id="noteref_231" name="noteref_231" href="#note_231"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">231</span></span></a> as it came to be called
in derision. The Tower of London was transferred
to the custody of the barons, and they were for the
future to appoint the justiciar. Towards the end of
July, a deputation from the barons waited upon the
mayor and citizens to learn if they approved of the
agreement that had been made with the king.<a id="noteref_232" name="noteref_232" href="#note_232"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">232</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The mayor, aldermen, and citizens, after a hasty

"saving unto them all their liberties and customs,"
and the city's common seal was set to the so-called

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was not long before the city discovered that
the barons were as little likely to respect its liberties
as the king himself. Hugh Bigod, whom they had<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page090">[pg 090]</span><a name="Pg090" id="Pg090" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
appointed justiciar gave offence by the way he
exercised his office. In spite of all remonstrance he
insisted upon sitting at the Guildhall to hear pleas,
a jurisdiction which belonged exclusively to the
sheriffs. He summoned the bakers of the city to
appear before him, and those who were convicted of
selling bread under weight he punished, in a way that
was not in conformity with city usage.<a id="noteref_233" name="noteref_233" href="#note_233"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">233</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In November of the following year (1259), Henry
took occasion of his departure for the continent to
make some popular concessions to the citizens. He
appeared at a Folkmote, which was being held at
Paul's Cross, and, before taking leave, he announced
that in future the citizens should be allowed to plead
their own cases (without employing legal aid) in all
the courts of the city, excepting in pleas of the
crown, pleas of land, and of wrongful distress. On
the same day John Mansel who had been one of
the king's justiciars in 1257, when the city was "taken
into the king's hand," and Fitz-Thedmar had been
indicted and deprived of his aldermanry for upholding
the privileges of the citizens<a id="noteref_234" name="noteref_234" href="#note_234"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">234</span></span></a>—publicly acknowledged
on the king's behalf the injustice of Fitz-Thedmar's

recalled him to favour, but commanded that he should
be restored to his former position.<a id="noteref_235" name="noteref_235" href="#note_235"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">235</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During the king's absence abroad, the barons'
cause was materially strengthened by the support
afforded Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, by
the king's son. Upon hearing of the defection
of his son, Henry hurried back to England.<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page091">[pg 091]</span><a name="Pg091" id="Pg091" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc58" id="toc58"></a>
A consultation took place in the city as to the attitude
which the citizens ought to take up, with the result
that when Henry appeared (April, 1260), both he and
the Earl of Gloucester were admitted into the city,
whilst the Earl of Leicester and "Sir Edward," as
the chronicler styles the king's son, had to find
accommodation in the suburbs.<a id="noteref_236" name="noteref_236" href="#note_236"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">236</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Henry was now master of the situation. The
city was his, and he determined that it should remain
so. Strict watch was kept over the gates, which for
the most part, were kept shut night and day in order
to prevent surprise. Every inhabitant of the age of
twelve years and upwards was called upon to take an
oath of allegiance before the alderman of his ward,
and those of maturer age were bound to provide
themselves with arms. The king, who now ruled
again in his own way, stirred the anger of the barons,
by presuming to appoint Philip Basset, his chief
justiciar, without first asking their assent; and the
barons retaliated by removing the king's sheriffs, and
appointing "wardens of the counties" in their stead.<a id="noteref_237" name="noteref_237" href="#note_237"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">237</span></span></a>
In June 1261, Henry produced a Bull of Alexander IV,
annulling the Provisions of Oxford, and freeing him
from his oath.<a id="noteref_238" name="noteref_238" href="#note_238"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">238</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For eighteen months the king reigned supreme.
The barons could do nothing, and the Earl of Leicester,
finding their cause hopeless, withdrew in August (1261)
to France, and remained there until the spring of
1263, when he returned as the unquestioned head of<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg 092]</span><a name="Pg092" id="Pg092" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the baronial party, to take up arms against the king.
The citizens professed loyalty to Henry, who was residing
in the Tower, and bound themselves by oath to
acknowledge his son Edward as heir to the crown.<a id="noteref_239" name="noteref_239" href="#note_239"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">239</span></span></a>
At Whitsuntide, the barons sent a letter to the king
requiring him to observe the Provisions of Oxford,
and shortly afterwards, addressed another letter to the
citizens "desiring to be certified by them whether
they would observe the said ordinances and statutes
made to the honour of God in fealty to his lordship
the king, and to his advantage of all the realm, or
would, in preference, adhere to those who wished
to infringe the same."<a id="noteref_240" name="noteref_240" href="#note_240"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">240</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before sending a reply, the citizens had an interview
with the king in the Tower, to whom they
showed the barons' letter. The result was, that
Henry availed himself of their services to mediate
between him and the barons. A deputation of citizens
accordingly travelled to Dover, where an understanding
was arrived at between the hostile parties.
The citizens were prepared to support the barons,
subject to their fealty to the king and saving their
own liberties; whilst the king promised to dismiss his
foreign supporters—the real cause of all the mischief.
Hugh le Despenser, whom Henry had deposed, was
again installed justiciar of all England in the Tower;
and the king and his family left the city for Westminster,
the day after the barons entered it. "Thus
was a league made between the barons and the
citizens with this reservation—'saving fealty to his
lordship the king.'"<a id="noteref_241" name="noteref_241" href="#note_241"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">241</span></span></a></p>

the Mayor. 1262.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whilst the commons of England were thus
winning their way to liberty, the commons of the city
were engaged in a similar struggle with the aristocratic
element of the municipal government.  The craft
guilds cried out against the exclusiveness of the more
wealthy and aristocratic trade guilds, the members of
which monopolized the city's rule. They found an
able champion of their cause in the person of Thomas
Fitz-Thomas, the mayor for the time being (1261-1265).
The mayor's action in the matter disgusted
Fitz-Thedmar, the city alderman and chronicler, who
complains that he "so pampered the city populace,"
that they styled themselves the "commons of the
city," and had obtained the first voice in the city.
The mayor would ask them their will as to whether
this or that thing should be done; and if they
answered "ya" "ya," it was done, without consulting
the aldermen or chief citizens, whose very existence
was ignored.<a id="noteref_242" name="noteref_242" href="#note_242"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">242</span></span></a> It is not surprising that, under a mayor
so thoroughly in sympathy with the people, opportunity
was taken by the citizens to rectify abuses from
which they had so long suffered. Their trade had
been prejudiced by the number of foreigners which
the king had introduced into the city, and accordingly
we read of an attack made on the houses of some
French merchants. Rights of way which had been
stopped up, were again opened, and where land
had been illegally built upon, the buildings were
abated.</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page094">[pg 094]</span><a name="Pg094" id="Pg094" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The chronicler complains of the populace acting
"like so many justices itinerant." It was in vain that
the king addressed a letter to the mayor and citizens,
setting forth that the dissensions between himself and
the barons had been settled, and commanding his peace
to be kept as well within the city as without.<a id="noteref_243" name="noteref_243" href="#note_243"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">243</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The popular movement received every encouragement
from the barons. Let those who were disaffected
put their complaints into writing, and the barons
would see that the matter was duly laid before the
king, and that the city's liberties were not diminished.
Fortified with such promises, the mayor set to work
at once to organize the craft guilds. Ordinances
were drawn up "abominations" Fitz-Thedmar calls
them<a id="noteref_244" name="noteref_244" href="#note_244"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">244</span></span></a> for the amelioration of the members, and

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A few days before Henry and the barons had
concluded a temporary peace, the citizens had been
greatly excited by an action of the king's son. Henry
was, as usual, in want of money, and had failed to raise
a loan in the city. His son came to his assistance and
seized the money and jewels lying at the Temple (29th
June). The citizens were so exasperated at this high-handed
proceeding on the part of the prince that they
vented their spleen on the queen, and pelted her with
mud and stones, calling her all kinds of opprobrious
names, as she attempted to pass in her barge under
London Bridge on her way from the Tower to
Windsor. (13th July).<a id="noteref_245" name="noteref_245" href="#note_245"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">245</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such conduct very naturally incensed the king
and his son against the citizens. Henry was angry
with them, moreover, for having admitted the barons
contrary to his express orders.<a id="noteref_246" name="noteref_246" href="#note_246"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">246</span></span></a> It is not surprising,
therefore, that when Fitz-Thomas presented himself
before the Barons of the Exchequer to be admitted to
the mayoralty for the third year in succession, they
refused to admit him by the king's orders, Henry
"being for many reasons greatly moved to anger
against the city."<a id="noteref_247" name="noteref_247" href="#note_247"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">247</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before the end of the year (1263), both king and
barons agreed to submit to the arbitration of the
King of France. The award known as the Mise of
Amien—from the place whence it was issue—which
Louis made on the 23rd Jan., 1264, proved of so one-sided
a character that the barons had no alternative but
to reject it. However unjustifiable such repudiation
on the part of the barons may have been from a moral
point of view, it was a matter of necessity. Many
of them, moreover, including those of the Cinque Ports,
as well as the Londoners, and nearly all the middle
class of England, had not been parties to the arbitration,
and therefore, were not pledged to accept the
award.<a id="noteref_248" name="noteref_248" href="#note_248"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">248</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The citizens and the barons now entered into

which was to stand prepared night and day to muster

the Cinque Ports. In the early morning of the 14th
he came upon the royal army at Lewes. Prince
Edward himself led the charge against the Londoners—he
had not forgotten the insult they had recently
offered to his mother—and succeeded in driving them
off the field. They scarcely indeed awaited his onslaught,
so unpractised in warfare had they become of
recent years, but turned their backs and sped away
towards London, followed in hot pursuit by Edward.
When he returned he found that, owing to his absence,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The barons returned to the city in triumph, bringing
the king and Richard, king of the Romans, in their

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The short respite—for it proved to be no more—from
civil war was welcomed by the Londoners. The
city had been drained of a large part of its population
in order to increase the Earl of Leicester's army, and
business had been seriously disturbed. For the past
year no Court of Husting had been held, and therefore
no wills or testaments had received probate; whilst all

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The citizens of London were soon to experience
the change that had taken place in the state of affairs.
The day after Michaelmas, the mayor and citizens
proceeded to Westminster to present the new sheriffs
to the Barons of the Exchequer; but finding no one
there, they returned home. The truth was that the
king had resorted to his favourite measure of taking
the city into his own hands for its adherence to the
late Earl of Leicester; and for five years it so
remained, being governed by a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">custos</span></span> or warden
appointed by the king, in the place of a mayor elected
by the citizens.<a id="noteref_259" name="noteref_259" href="#note_259"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">259</span></span></a></p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">Threat of the king to subdue the city by force.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There had been some talk of the king meditating
an attack upon the city, and treating its inhabitants as
avowed enemies.<a id="noteref_260" name="noteref_260" href="#note_260"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">260</span></span></a> The very threat of such a proceeding
was sufficient to throw the city into the
utmost state of confusion. Some there were "fools
and evil-minded persons," as our chronicler describes
them—who favoured resisting force by force; but the
"most discreet men" of the city, and those who had
joined the Earl under compulsion, would have none
of it, preferring to solicit the king's favour through
the mediation of men of the religious orders. Henry<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
still remained unmoved, and the fear of the citizens
increased to such an extent that it was finally resolved
that the citizens as a body should make humble
submission to the king; and that the same should
be forwarded to him at Windsor under the common
seal of the city. Whilst the deputation bearing this
document was on its way it was met by Sir Roger
de Leiburn, who turned it back on the ground that he
himself was on his way to the city for the express
purpose of arranging terms of submission.<a id="noteref_261" name="noteref_261" href="#note_261"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">261</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That night Sir Roger lodged at the Tower, and
the next morning he went to Barking Church, on the
confines of the city,<a id="noteref_262" name="noteref_262" href="#note_262"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">262</span></span></a> where he was met by the mayor
and a "countless multitude" of the citizens. The
advice he had to give the citizens was that if they
wished to be reconciled to the king, they would have
to submit their lives and property unreservedly to his
will. Letters patent were drawn up to that effect
under the common seal, and taken by Sir Roger
himself to Windsor. The citizens had not long to
wait for an answer. The king's first demand was
the removal of the posts and chains which had been
set up in the streets as a means of defence. His next
was that the mayor—his old antagonist Fitz-Thomas—and
the principal men of the city should come in
person to him at Windsor, under letters of safe conduct.
Trusting to the royal word, the mayor and about
forty of the more substantial men of the city proceeded
to Windsor, there to await a conference with
the king. To their great surprise, the whole of the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc63" id="toc63"></a>

They were practically treated as prisoners.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some regained their liberty, but of Fitz-Thomas
nothing more is heard. From the time that he entered
Windsor Castle, he disappears from public view. That
he was alive in May, 1266, at least in the belief of his
fellow-citizens, is shown by their cry for the release
of him and his companions "who are at Windleshores."
They would again have made him Mayor, if they
could have had their own way. "We will have no
one for mayor" (they cried) "save only Thomas
Fitz-Thomas."<a id="noteref_263" name="noteref_263" href="#note_263"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">263</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime the king had himself gone to
London and confiscated the property of more than
sixty of the citizens, driving them out of their house
and home. Hugh Fitz-Otes, the Constable of the
Tower, had been appointed warden of the city in the
place of the imprisoned mayor; bailiffs had been
substituted for sheriffs, and the citizens made to pay a
fine of 20,000 marks. Then, and only then, did the
king consent to grant their pardon.<a id="noteref_264" name="noteref_264" href="#note_264"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">264</span></span></a></p>

was presented by the king with the custody
of London Bridge, the issues and profits of which
she was allowed to enjoy. She allowed the bridge,
however, to fall into such decay, that she thought she<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
could not do better than restore it to its rightful
owners. This she accordingly did in 1271, but soon
afterwards changed her mind, and again took the
bridge into her charge.<a id="noteref_266" name="noteref_266" href="#note_266"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">266</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At Easter, 1267, the Earl of Gloucester, who had
constituted himself the avowed champion of those
who had suffered forfeiture, and become "disinherited"
for the part they had taken with the Earl of Leicester,
sought admission to the city. The citizens hesitated
to receive him within their gates, although according
to some, he was armed with letters patent of the
king addressed to the citizens on his behalf.<a id="noteref_267" name="noteref_267" href="#note_267"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">267</span></span></a> Under
pretence of holding a conference with the papal legate
at the Church of Holy Trinity, Aldgate, he gained
admission for himself and followers: and there he
remained, having made himself master of the city's
gates.<a id="noteref_268" name="noteref_268" href="#note_268"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">268</span></span></a> Thereupon many citizens left the city, fearing
the wrath of the king, and once more the city was in
the hands of the populace. The leading citizens were
placed under a guard; the aldermen and bailiffs were
deposed to make way for the earl's own supporters,
and, for better security, a covered way of timber was
made from the city to the Tower.<a id="noteref_269" name="noteref_269" href="#note_269"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">269</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whatever may have been the actual part played

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At length the king and the Earl of Gloucester
came to terms (16 June). The earl was to have his
property restored to him, and the city was to be
forgiven all trespasses committed against the king
since the time that the earl made his sojourn within
its walls. The earl gave surety in 10,000 marks for
keeping the peace, and the citizens paid the king of
the Romans 1,000 marks for damages they had
committed three years before in his manor of
Isleworth.<a id="noteref_271" name="noteref_271" href="#note_271"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">271</span></span></a> Not a word about the imprisoned mayor,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Towards the end of this year or early in the next

recovered the right to elect their mayor, so long withheld.
"About the same time, that is to say,
Pentecost, 1270," writes Fitz-Thedmar, "at the

Walter le Poter were elected sheriffs. After they
had been severally admitted into office—the mayor
before the king himself on Wednesday, the 16th July,
and the sheriffs at the Exchequer two days later—the
king restored the city's charters, and the citizens
acknowledged the royal favour by a gift of 100 marks
to the king, and 500 marks to Prince Edward, who
had proved so good a friend to them, and who was
about to set out for the Holy Land.<a id="noteref_277" name="noteref_277" href="#note_277"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">277</span></span></a></p>

He made himself so popular with the "commons" of
the city during his year of office, that when October,
1272, came round and the aldermen and more
"discreet" citizens were in favour of electing Philip
le Taillour as his successor, the commons or "mob of

out, "Nay, nay, we will have no one for mayor

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The aldermen finding themselves in a minority,
appealed to the king and council at Westminster.
Hervy did the same, being accompanied to Westminster
by a large number of supporters, who took
the opportunity of the aldermen laying their case
before the council to insist loudly, as they waited in
the adjacent hall, upon their own right of election
and their choice of Hervy. It was feared that the
noise might disturb the king who was confined to his
bed with what proved to be his last illness. All
parties was therefore dismissed, injunction being laid
upon Hervy not to appear again with such a following,
but to come with only ten or a dozen supporters
at the most.</p>

to present himself at Westminster every day

force, expecting an answer to be given by the council.
At length the council resolved to submit the whole
question to arbitration, the city in the meanwhile
being placed in the custody of a warden. Before the

and rather than the city should continue to be

to give their assent to Hervy's election to the

object of dislike, more especially to Fitz-Thomas.
When, therefore, that chronicler records that throughout
Hervy's year of office he did not allow any
pleading in the Husting for Pleas of Land except very
rarely, for the reason that the mayor himself was
defendant in a suit brought against him by Isabella

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hervy was a worthy successor to Fitz-Thomas,
and, under his government, the craft guilds improved
their position. Fresh ordinances for the regulation of
various crafts were drawn up, and to these the mayor,
on his own responsibility, attached the city seal.<a id="noteref_283" name="noteref_283" href="#note_283"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">283</span></span></a><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span><a name="Pg108" id="Pg108" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
When Hervy's year of office expired—these so-called
"charters" were called in question as having been
unauthorised by the aldermen of the city and as
tending to favour the richer members of the guilds
to the prejudice of the poorer. After a "wordy and
most abusive dispute" carried on in the Guildhall
between the ex-mayor and Gregory de Rokesley who
acted as spokesman for the body of aldermen, Hervy
left the hall and summoned the craft-guilds to meet
him in Cheapside. There he told them that it was the
wish of Henry le Galeys (or Waleys) the mayor and
others to infringe their charters, but that if they could
stand by him he would maintain those charters in all
their integrity.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Fearing lest a riot might follow, the chancellor—Walter
de Merton, through whose mediation Hervy
had been at last accepted as mayor by the aldermen—ordered
his arrest. This was on the 20th December,
1273. Hervy was, accordingly, attached but
released on bail, and early in the following January
(1274), his charters were duly examined in the
Husting before all the people, and declared void.
Thenceforth, every man was to enjoy the utmost
freedom in following his calling, always provided that
his work was good and lawful.<a id="noteref_284" name="noteref_284" href="#note_284"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">284</span></span></a></p>

appearance to the king on his return from abroad,
the owners of the stalls, who complained of being
disturbed in their freeholds—"having given to the
sheriff a great sum of money for the same"—found<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg 109]</span><a name="Pg109" id="Pg109" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc69" id="toc69"></a>
a champion in Hervy. Their cause was pleaded at
the Guildhall, and such "a wordy strife" arose
between Hervy and the mayor, that the session had
to be broken up, and Hervy's conduct was reported to
the king's council. The next day, upon the resumption
of the session, a certain roll was produced and
publicly read, in which "the presumptuous acts and
injuries, of most notorious character" which Hervy
was alleged to have committed during his mayoralty
were set forth at length.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The charges against him were eight in number,
of which some at least appear to be in the last degree
frivolous. He had on a certain occasion borne false
witness; he had failed on another occasion to attend
at Westminster upon a summons; he had failed to
observe all the assizes made by the aldermen and had
allowed ale to be sold in his ward for three halfpence
a gallon; he had taken bribes for allowing corn and
wine to be taken out of the city for sale, and he had
misappropriated a sum of money which had been
raised for a special purpose. Such was the general
run of the charges brought against him, in addition to
which were the charges of having permitted the
guilds to make new statutes to their own advantage
and to the loss of the city and all the realm, as
already narrated, and of having procured "certain
persons of the city, of Stebney, of Stratford, and of
Hakeneye" to make an unjust complaint against the
mayor, "who had warranty sufficient for what he had
done, namely, the council of his lordship the king."
This last charge had reference to the recent removal
of tradesmen's stalls from Chepe. No defence
appears to have been allowed Hervy. The charges<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page110">[pg 110]</span><a name="Pg110" id="Pg110" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
were read, and he was then and there declared to be
"judicially degraded from his aldermanry and for
ever excluded from the council of the city"; a precept
being at the same time issued for the immediate

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">The after-results of the policy of Hervy and Fitz-Thomas.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From this time forward nothing more is heard
of Hervy. The same cloud envelopes his later
history, that gathered round the last years of his
predecessor and political tutor Thomas Fitz-Thomas.
The misfortune of both of these men was that they
lived before their age. Their works bore fruit long
after they had departed. The trade or craft guilds, as
distinguished from the more wealthy and influential
mercantile guilds, eventually played an important
part in the city. Under Edward II, no stranger
could obtain the freedom of the city (without which,
he could do little or nothing), unless he became a
member of one of these guilds, or sought the suffrages
of the commonalty of the city, before admission to
the freedom in the Court of Husting.<a id="noteref_286" name="noteref_286" href="#note_286"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">286</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The normal and more expeditious way of obtaining
the freedom was thus through a guild. If Hervy
or Fitz-Thomas lived till the year 1319, when the
Ordinances just cited received the king's sanction, he
must have felt that the struggle he had made to raise
the lesser guilds had not been in vain. The mercantile
element in the city, which had formerly overcome<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg 111]</span><a name="Pg111" id="Pg111" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc70" id="toc70"></a>
the aristocratic element,<a id="noteref_287" name="noteref_287" href="#note_287"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">287</span></span></a> in its turn gave way to the
numerical superiority and influence of the craft and
manufacturing element. Hence it was that in 1376—when
the number of trade or craft guilds in the
city compared with the larger mercantile guilds was
as forty to eight—the guilds succeeded in wresting for
a while from the wards the right of electing members
of the city's council.<a id="noteref_288" name="noteref_288" href="#note_288"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">288</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime, King Edward I, arrived in

much earlier, and had addressed a letter to the mayor,

eighteen months before, informing them of his purposed
speedy return, and of his wishes that they
should endeavour to preserve the peace of the realm.<a id="noteref_290" name="noteref_290" href="#note_290"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">290</span></span></a>

3rd April, 1274.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before setting sail for England, Edward despatched
a letter (3rd April), "to his well-beloved, the mayor,
barons, and reputable men of London," thanking
them for the preparations he understood they were
making for the ceremony of his coronation, and bidding
them send a deputation of four of the more discreet
of the citizens, to him at Paris, for the purpose
of a special conference.<a id="noteref_292" name="noteref_292" href="#note_292"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">292</span></span></a></p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">The object of the conference.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The difficulty which gave rise to this conference
and to the signal mark of distinction bestowed upon
the citizens of London, proved to be of a commercial
character, and, as such, one upon which the
opinions of the leading merchants of London would
be of especial value. Ever since the year 1270, the
commercial relationship between England and Flanders
had been strained. The Countess of Flanders
had thought fit to lay hands upon the wool and other
merchandise belonging to English merchants found
within her dominions, and to appropriate the same to
her own use. Edward's predecessor on the throne
had thereupon issued a writ to the mayor and sheriffs
of London, forbidding in future the export of wool to
any parts beyond sea whatsoever,<a id="noteref_293" name="noteref_293" href="#note_293"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">293</span></span></a> but this measure
not having the desired effect, he shortly afterwards
had recourse to reprisals.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 28th June, 1270, a writ had been issued to
the same parties ordering them to seize the goods of<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc71" id="toc71"></a>
all Flemings, Hainaulters, and other subjects of the
Countess, for the purpose of satisfying the claims of
English merchants; and all subjects of the Countess,
except those workmen who had received express permission
to come to England for the purpose of making
cloth, and those who had taken to themselves English
wives, and had obtained a domicile in this country, were
to quit the realm by a certain date.<a id="noteref_294" name="noteref_294" href="#note_294"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">294</span></span></a> Those Flemings
who neglected this injunction were to be seized and
kept in custody until further orders, and the same
measures were to be taken with those who harboured
them. In the meantime, an inquisition was ordered
to be made as to the amount and value of the goods
seized by the Countess, and the English merchants were
to lodge their respective claims for compensation.</p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">Interruption of trade between England and Flanders.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The interruption of trade between England—at
that time the chief wool-exporting country in the
world—and Flanders where the cloth-working industry
especially flourished, caused much tribulation;
and the King of France, the Duke of Brabant, and
other foreign potentates, whose subjects began to feel
the effect of this commercial disturbance, addressed
letters to the King of England, requesting that their
merchants might enter his realm and stay, and traffic
there as formerly. They had never offended the King
or his people; the Countess of Flanders was the sole
offender, and she alone ought to be punished. The
matter having received due consideration, the embargo
on the export of wool was taken off with respect to
all countries, except Flanders, with the proviso that
no wool should be exported out of the kingdom without
special license from the king.<a id="noteref_295" name="noteref_295" href="#note_295"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">295</span></span></a></p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page114">[pg 114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By the month of October, 1271, the inquisitors,
who had been appointed to appraise the goods and
chattels of Flemings in England, were able to report
to parliament that their value amounted to £8,000
"together with the king's debt," whilst the value of
merchandise belonging to English merchants and seized
by the countess amounted to £7,000, besides chattels
of other merchants. Parliament again sat in January
of the new year to consider the claims of English
merchants, when those whose goods had been taken
in Flanders, "and the Londoners more especially,"
appeared in person. Each stated the amount of his
loss and the amount of goods belonging to Flemings
which he had in hand, and a balance was struck. An
inquisition was, at the same time, taken in each of
the city wards, as to the number of merchants who
bought, sold, exchanged, or harboured the goods of
persons belonging to the dominion of the Countess;
and also as to who had taken wools out of England
to the parts beyond the sea, contrary to the king's
prohibition.<a id="noteref_296" name="noteref_296" href="#note_296"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">296</span></span></a> Many Flemings, still lurking in the city,
were arrested, and only liberated on condition they
abjured the realm so long as the dispute between
England and Flanders should continue. Nearly six
months elapsed before any further steps were taken by
either party in the strife. The Countess then showed
signs of giving way. Envoys from her arrived in
England. She was willing to make satisfaction to all
English merchants for the losses they had sustained,
but this was to be subject to the condition that the
king should bind himself to discharge certain alleged
debts, which had been the cause of all the mischief from<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc72" id="toc72"></a>
the outset, within a fixed time. In the event of the
king failing to discharge these claims, the justice of
which he never recognised, the Countess was to be
allowed to distrain all persons coming into her country
from England by their bodies and their goods,
until satisfaction should be made for arrears. This
haughty message only made matters worse. The king
and his council became indignant, and contemptuously
dismissed the envoys, commanding them to leave
England within three days on peril of life and limb.<a id="noteref_297" name="noteref_297" href="#note_297"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">297</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Time went on; Henry died, and before his son
Edward arrived in England from the Holy Land to
take up the reins of government, his chancellor,
Walter de Merton, had caused a proclamation to be
made throughout the city, forbidding any Fleming to
enter the kingdom, under penalty of forfeiture of
person and goods. The proclamation was more than
ordinarily stringent, for it went on to say that if perchance
any individual had received special permission
from the late king to sojourn and to trade within the
realm, such permission was no longer to hold good,
but the foreigner was to pack up his merchandise,
collect his debts, and leave the country by Christmas,
1273, at the latest.<a id="noteref_298" name="noteref_298" href="#note_298"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">298</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Countess had probably hoped that a change
of monarch on the English throne would have
favoured her cause. This proclamation was sufficient
to show her the character of the king with whom she
had in future to deal, and destroyed any hope she
may have entertained in this direction. She therefore
took the opportunity of Edward's passing through
Paris to London, to open negotiations for the purpose<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116" id="Pg116" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of restoring peace between England and Flanders;
and it was to assist the king in conducting these
negotiations, that he had summoned a deputation of
citizens of London to meet him at Paris.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The choice of the citizens fell upon Henry le
Waleys, their mayor for the time being, one who was
known almost as well in France as in the city of
London, if we may judge from the fact of his filling
the office of Mayor of Bordeaux in the following year.
With him were chosen Gregory de Rokesley who,
besides being a large dealer in wool, was also a goldsmith
and financier, and as such was shortly to be
appointed master of the exchange throughout
England;<a id="noteref_299" name="noteref_299" href="#note_299"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">299</span></span></a> John Horn, whose name bespeaks his

been appointed, as one who was intimate with both
sides of the question under discussion; and Luke de

the Sheriffs of London this same year.</p>

certain others whose names are not mentioned again
set out in compliance with orders received from the
king; the object of their journey being, as we are
expressly told, to treat of peace between the king and
the Countess of Flanders at Montreuil.<a id="noteref_302" name="noteref_302" href="#note_302"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">302</span></span></a> A month

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The king ruled the city, as indeed he ruled the
rest of the kingdom, with a strong hand. Londoners
had already experienced the force of his arm and his
ability in the field, when he scattered them at Lewes;
they were now to experience the benefit of his powers
of organization in time of peace. Fitz-Thedmar's
chronicle now fails us, but we have a new source of
information in the letter books<a id="noteref_303" name="noteref_303" href="#note_303"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">303</span></span></a> of the Corporation.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first and the most pressing difficulty which
presented itself to Edward, was the re-organization
of finance. Without money the barons could not be
kept within legitimate bounds. Having won their
cause against the usurpations of the crown, they
began to turn their arms upon each other, and it
required Edward's strong hand not only to impose
order upon his unruly nobles, but also, to bring<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Scotland and Wales into submission. The country
was flooded with clipt coin. This was called in, and
new money minted at the Tower, under the supervision
of Gregory de Rokesley as Master of the
Exchange.<a id="noteref_304" name="noteref_304" href="#note_304"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">304</span></span></a> Parliament made large grants to the

parliament by some chroniclers—was summoned to
meet at Shrewsbury to attend the trial of David,
brother of Llewelyn, Prince of Wales. To this so-called
parliament the city sent no less than six
representatives, viz.: Henry le Waleys, the mayor,
Gregory de Rokesley, Philip Cissor, or the tailor,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of Ralph Crepyn, one of the city's representatives
at Shrewsbury, a tragic story is told. Meeting, one
day, Laurence Duket, his rival in the affections of a
woman known as "Alice atte Bowe," the two came to
blows, and Crepyn was wounded. The affray took
place in Cheapside, and Duket, fearing he had killed
his man, sought sanctuary in Bow Church. Crepyn's
friends, hearing of the matter, followed and having
killed Duket, disposed of their victim's body in such
a way as to suggest suicide. It so happened, however,
that the sacrilegious murder had been witnessed by a
boy who informed against the culprits and no less
than sixteen persons were hanged for the part they
had taken in it. Alice, herself, was condemned to be
burnt alive as being the chief instigator of the murder;
others, including Ralph Crepyn, were sent to the
Tower, and only released on payment of heavy fines.<a id="noteref_309" name="noteref_309" href="#note_309"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">309</span></span></a>
The church was placed under interdict, the doors and
windows being filled with thorns until purification
had been duly made. Duket's remains, which had
been interred as those of a suicide, were afterwards
taken up and received the rights of Christian burial in
Bow Churchyard.</p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">Legislative enactments of 1285.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The year 1285 was a memorable one both for
London and the kingdom. It witnessed the passing
of two important statutes. In the first place the
statute <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Donis</span></span> legalised the principle of tying up
real estate, so as to descend, in an exclusive perpetual
line; in other words, it sanctioned entails, and its<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page120">[pg 120]</span><a name="Pg120" id="Pg120" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
effect is still experienced at the present day in every
ordinary settlement of land. In the next place the
Assise of Arms of Henry II was improved so as to
secure for the king a national support in the time of
danger. In every hundred and franchise each man's
armour was to be viewed twice a year; and defaults
reported to the king "who would find a remedy."
The gates of walled towns were to be closed from
sun-set to sun-rise, and watch and ward were to be
kept as strictly as in times past, "that is to wit, from
the day of the Ascension until the day of S. Michael,
in every city by six men at every gate; in every
borough, twelve men; every town, six or four,
according to the number of the inhabitants of the
town, and they shall watch the town continually all
night from the sun-setting unto the sun-rising."<a id="noteref_310" name="noteref_310" href="#note_310"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">310</span></span></a>
Three years previous to the passing of this statute the
mayor, alderman and chamberlain had made very
similar provisions for the keeping of the City of
London, the city's gates, and the river Thames.<a id="noteref_311" name="noteref_311" href="#note_311"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">311</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For the city, the year was a memorable one,
owing to the suspension of its franchise. The
circumstances which caused the loss of its liberties
for a period of thirteen years (1285-1298) were these.
The king's justiciars were sitting at the Tower, where
the mayor, sheriffs, and aldermen of the city had
been summoned to attend. Owing to some informality
in the summons, Gregory de Rokesley, the
Mayor, declined to attend in his official capacity, but
formally "deposed himself" at the Church of All
Hallows Barking—the limit of the city jurisdiction—<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg 121]</span><a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc75" id="toc75"></a>
by handing the city's seal to Stephen Aswy or Eswy,
a brother alderman. On entering the chamber where
sat the justiciars, the mayor excused his unofficial
appearance on the ground of insufficient notice. This
was not what the justiciars had been accustomed to.
On the contrary, the citizens had usually shown studied
respect towards the justiciars whenever they came to
the Tower for the purpose of holding pleas of the
crown.</p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">The customary procedure when the citizens waited on the justices at the Tower.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The rules of procedure on such occasions are
fully set out in the city's "Liber Albus,"<a id="noteref_312" name="noteref_312" href="#note_312"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">312</span></span></a> and they
contain, curiously enough, a provision expressly made
for cases where the full notice of forty days had not
been given. In such an event the prescribed rule was
to send some of their more discreet citizens to the
king and his council to ask for the appointment of
another day. Whether Rokesley had taken this step
before resorting to the measures he did we are not
told. It was also the custom on such occasions for
the citizens to gather at Barking Church, clothed in
their best apparel, and thence proceed in a body to
the Tower. A deputation was appointed—selected
members of the common council—who should also
proceed to the Tower for the purpose of giving an
official welcome to the justiciars on behalf of the
citizens. It was not thought to be in any way derogatory
to secure the goodwill of the king's justiciars
by making ample presents. It had been done time
out of mind. The sheriffs and aldermen were to
attend with their respective sergeants and beadles,
the benches at the Tower were to be examined
beforehand and necessary repairs carried out, all shops<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg 122]</span><a name="Pg122" id="Pg122" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
were to be closed and no business transacted during
the session. In a word, everything was to be done
that could add to the dignity of the justiciars and
the solemnity of the occasion. In contrast with all
this, Rokesley's conduct was indeed strange, and leads
us to suppose that his action was caused by some
other and stronger reason than the mere omission
to give the usual notice of the coming of the king's
justiciars.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Be this as it may, the king's treasurer, who may
possibly have been forewarned of what was about to
take place, at once decided what course to take. He
declared the city to be there and then taken into the
king's hands, on the pretext that it was found to be
without a mayor, and he summoned the citizens to
appear on the morrow before the king at Westminster.
When the morrow came, the citizens duly appeared,
and about eighty of them were detained. Those who
accompanied Rokesley to Barking Church on the
previous day were confined in the Tower, but after a
few days they were all set at liberty, with the exception
of Stephen Aswy, who was removed in custody
to Windsor.<a id="noteref_313" name="noteref_313" href="#note_313"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">313</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In May, 1286, the king went to Gascony, leaving
the country in charge of his nephew, Edmund, Earl
of Cornwall, and did not return until August, 1289.
He was then in sore straits for money, as was so
often the case with him, and was glad of a present of
£1,000 which the citizens offered by way of courtesy
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">curialitas</span></span>). The money was ordered (14th October)
to be levied by poll,<a id="noteref_315" name="noteref_315" href="#note_315"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">315</span></span></a> but many of the inhabitants

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The expulsion of the Jews in 1290 increased
Edward's difficulties, for on them he chiefly depended
for replenishing his empty exchequer. Their expulsion
was not so much his own wish as the wish of his
subjects, who, being largely in debt to the Jews,
regarded them as cruel tyrants. The nation soon
discovered that it had made a mistake in thus getting
rid of its creditors, for in the absence of the Jews,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg 124]</span><a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Edward was compelled to resort to the Lombard
merchants. It may possibly have been owing to
some monetary transactions between them that the
king was solicitous of getting a life interest in the
city's Small Beam made over to a lady known as
Jacobina la Lumbard. No particulars are known
of this lady, but to judge from her name she probably
came of a family of money-lenders, and if so, the
king's action in writing from Berwick (28th June,
1291) to the warden and aldermen of the city—at a
time when he was completely in the hands of the
Italian goldsmiths and money-lenders—soliciting for
her a more or less lucrative post is easily intelligible.<a id="noteref_318" name="noteref_318" href="#note_318"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">318</span></span></a>
The king's request was refused, notwithstanding the
city being at the time in charge of a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">custos</span></span> of his own
choice instead of a mayor elected by the citizens
themselves. Such requests produced friction between
the king and the city, and the former's financial
relations with the foreign merchants were fraught
with danger to himself and to his son.<a id="noteref_319" name="noteref_319" href="#note_319"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">319</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Edward's anxiety was in the meanwhile increased
by domestic troubles. In 1290 he suffered a bitter
disappointment by the death of a Scottish princess
who was affianced to his son, the Prince of Wales,
and thus a much-cherished plan for establishing
friendly relations between the two countries was
frustrated.  But this disappointment was quickly<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page125">[pg 125]</span><a name="Pg125" id="Pg125" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc77" id="toc77"></a>
cast in the shade by the more severe affliction he
suffered in the loss of his wife. In November Queen
Eleanor died. Her corpse was brought from Lincoln
to Westminster, and the bereaved husband ordered a
memorial cross to be set up at each place where
her body rested. One of these crosses was erected
at the west end of Cheapside. After the Reformation
the images with which the cross was ornamented,
like the image of Becket set over the gate
of the Mercers' Chapel, roused the anger of the
iconoclast, who took delight in defacing them.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Time only increased the king's pecuniary difficulties.
In February, 1292, all freeholders of land of
the annual value of £40 were ordered to receive

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Instead of invading France, Edward found his
own shores devastated by a French fleet, whilst at
the same time his hands were full with fresh difficulties
from Scotland and Wales. In the summer of
1295, the city furnished the king with three ships,
the cost being defrayed by a tax of twopence in<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name="Pg126" id="Pg126" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the pound charged on chattels and merchandise.
John le Breton, then warden, advanced the sum of
£40, which the aldermen and six men of each ward
undertook to repay.<a id="noteref_323" name="noteref_323" href="#note_323"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">323</span></span></a> In the following year (1296)

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From Berwick Edward issued (26 Aug., 1296,)
writs for a Parliament to meet at Bury St. Edmund's,
in the following November. The constitution of
this Parliament was the same as that which had
met at Westminster in November of the previous
year (1295) and which was intended to serve as a
model parliament, a pattern for all future national
assemblies. The city was represented by two aldermen,
namely, Sir Stephen Aswy, or Eswy, who had
been confined in Windsor Castle ten years before for
his conduct towards the king's justiciars at the Tower,
and Sir William de Hereford.<a id="noteref_326" name="noteref_326" href="#note_326"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">326</span></span></a> From this time forward<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc78" id="toc78"></a>
down to the present day we have little difficulty in
discovering from one source or another the names of
the city's representatives in successive parliaments.
Edward, of course, wanted money. The barons and
knights increased their former grants; so also did the
burgesses. The clergy, on the other hand, declared
themselves unable to make any grant at all in the
face of a papal prohibition,<a id="noteref_327" name="noteref_327" href="#note_327"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">327</span></span></a> and the king was at last
driven to seize the lay fees of the clergy of the
province of Canterbury. In the spring of the following
year he proceeded to seize all the wool of the
country, paying for it by tallies, and to levy a supply
of provisions on the counties. The act was only
justifiable on the plea of necessity, and led to
measures being taken to prevent its repetition.<a id="noteref_328" name="noteref_328" href="#note_328"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">328</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was an easier matter for Edward to raise
money than to get the barons to accompany him
abroad. To leave them behind was to risk the peace
of the country. He therefore spared no efforts to
persuade them to join in a projected expedition, and
when persuasion failed tried threats. It was his
desire that the barons should go to Gascony, whilst
he took the command in Flanders. This was not at
all to the taste of the barons, who declined to go
abroad, except in the personal retinue of the king
himself. "With you, O king," said Roger Bigod, "I
will gladly go; as belongs to me by hereditary right,
I will go in front of the host, before your face;" but
without the king he positively declined to move.
"By God, earl," cried the king, fairly roused by the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg 128]</span><a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
obstinacy of his vassal, "you shall either go or
hang;" to which the earl replied, with equal determination,
"By the same token, O king, I will neither
go nor hang."<a id="noteref_329" name="noteref_329" href="#note_329"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">329</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nothing daunted, the king issued writs (15 May)
for a military levy of the whole kingdom for service
abroad, to meet at London on the 7th July, a
measure as unconstitutional as the seizure of wool
and the levying of taxes without the assent of
Parliament. On the day appointed, the barons, who
had received a large accession of strength from the
great vassals, appeared with their forces at St. Paul's;
but instead of complying with the king's demands—or
rather requests, for the king had altered his tone—they
prepared a list of their grievances.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With difficulty civil war was avoided, and in

his back turned, than the barons and the Londoners
made common cause in insisting upon a confirmation
and amplification of their charters.<a id="noteref_330" name="noteref_330" href="#note_330"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">330</span></span></a> Prince Edward,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the summer Edward marched to Scotland for
the purpose of putting down the rising under Wallace.
An account of the battle of Falkirk, fought on the
22nd July, was conveyed to the mayor, aldermen,
and "barons" of London, by letter from Walter
Langton, Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, or, as he
was then styled, Bishop of Chester, who wrote as an
eye-witness, if not indeed as a partaker in that day's
work.<a id="noteref_335" name="noteref_335" href="#note_335"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">335</span></span></a> It was the first battle of any consequence in
which the English long-bow was brought into prominence.
Edward's victory was complete. The enemy's
loss was great, the number that perished, according to
the bishop's information, being two hundred men-at-arms
and twenty thousand foot soldiers. Edward
was unable, however, to follow up his success for
want of supplies, and so retreated. In 1304, he again
marched northward, notwithstanding the defection of
many nobles. He had previously resorted once more
to the questionable practice of talliaging the city of<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

Sterling surrendered after a siege of two months, and

had generously offered.</p>

much from that of his father, was not one to commend
itself to the citizens of London. With them he never
became a favourite. The bold and determined character
of Queen Isabel, the very antipodes of her
husband, was more to their liking, and throughout
the contests that ensued between them, the citizens
steadily supported her cause. At her first appearance,
as a bride, in the city, the streets were compared with

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But even thus early in Edward of Carnarvon's
reign the presence of foreigners—to whom the king
was even more addicted than his father—was likely
to prove a source of trouble; and it was necessary to
make special proclamations forbidding the carrying of<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span><a name="Pg133" id="Pg133" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc83" id="toc83"></a>

king's foreign favourites proved his ruin, and contributed
in no small degree to the eventual defection of
the city. They were for ever desiring some favour of
the citizens. At one time it was Piers de Gavestone
who wanted a post for his "valet";<a id="noteref_344" name="noteref_344" href="#note_344"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">344</span></span></a> at another it
was Hugh le Despenser who desired (and obtained) a

only held the Beam for little more than six months,
and then, at the urgent request of the queen herself,
it was given to another.<a id="noteref_346" name="noteref_346" href="#note_346"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">346</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The barons were especially irritated at being
supplanted by the king's favourites, and in 1308
succeeded in getting Edward to send Gaveston out
of England. In the following year, however, he was
recalled, and the barons became so exasperated that
in 1310, when the king summoned an assembly of
bishops and barons, the latter appeared, contrary to
orders, in full military array. The king could not do
otherwise than submit to their dictation. Ordainers
were appointed from among the barons for the purpose
of drawing up ordinances for the government of
the kingdom. These ordinances were promulgated
in their complete form in 1311, when they received
the sanction of a parliament assembled at the House
of the Black Friars, in the month of August, and were
afterwards publicly proclaimed in St. Paul's Churchyard,<a id="noteref_347" name="noteref_347" href="#note_347"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">347</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime, whilst the Ordainers were engaged
on their work, Edward had put himself at the
head of his army and marched against the Scots, who
were rapidly gaining ground under Bruce. He remained
on the border until July, 1311, trying every
means to raise money. In March of that year the
city sent him one thousand marks, by the hands of
Roger le Palmere and William de Flete, the mayor,
Richer de Refham, contributing no less than one
hundred pounds of the whole sum. The money was
despatched on horseback, tied up in baskets covered
with matting and bound with cords, and the cost of
every particular is set out in the city's records.<a id="noteref_349" name="noteref_349" href="#note_349"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">349</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Refham was a mayor of the popular type. He
had already suffered deprivation of his aldermanry for
some reason or another, but was reinstated in 13O2.<a id="noteref_350" name="noteref_350" href="#note_350"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">350</span></span></a>
No sooner was he chosen mayor than he caused a
collection to be made of the ancient liberties and
customs of the city, from the books and rolls preserved
in the city's Chamber, and having assembled
the aldermen and best men of the city, he caused
them to be publicly read. This having been done,
he next proceeded to ask the assembly if it was their
will that these ancient customs and liberties, which
had so often been infringed by the removal of mayors<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg 135]</span><a name="Pg135" id="Pg135" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc84" id="toc84"></a>
and sheriffs, should be for the future maintained. Their
answer being given unanimously in the affirmative,
he at once took steps to obtain the king's writ of
confirmation, and caused them to be proclaimed
throughout the city. He made a perambulation of
the city and abated all nuisances and encroachments.
He went further than this. For some time past the
streets had been rendered unsafe to pass after dark
by bands of rioters who at that day were known by
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sobriquet</span></span> of "roreres." A few years later, the
same class went under the name of "riffleres." They
were the precursors of the "Muns," the "Tityre Tus,"
the "Hectors," and the "Scourers,"—dynasties of
tyrants, as Macaulay styles them, which domineered
over the streets of London, soon after the Restoration,
and at a later period were superseded by the "Nickers,"
the "Hawcubites," and the still more dreaded "Mohawks,"
of Queen Anne's reign. By whatever name
they happened at the time to be known, their practice
was the same, viz.:—assault and robbery of peaceful
citizens whose business or pleasure carried them
abroad after sundown.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During Refham's mayoralty, a raid was made on
all common nightwalkers, "bruisers" (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pugnatores</span></span>),
common "roreres," <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">wagabunds</span></span> and others, and many
were committed to prison, to the great relief of the
more peaceably disposed.<a id="noteref_351" name="noteref_351" href="#note_351"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">351</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His strictness and impartiality were such as to

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In January, 1312, the king returned to the north,
and as soon as he had arrived at York ignored the
ordinance touching Gaveston, and instead of sending
his favourite into exile, received him into favour and
restored his forfeited estates. Foreseeing the storm
that he would have to meet from the barons, the king
wrote from Knaresborough (9th Jan.) to Refham's
successor, John de Gisors, enjoining him to put the
city into a state of defence, and not allow armed men
to enter on any pretext whatever.<a id="noteref_353" name="noteref_353" href="#note_353"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">353</span></span></a> On the 21st he
wrote again, not only to the mayor, but to nineteen
leading men of the city, exhorting them to hold the
city for him.<a id="noteref_354" name="noteref_354" href="#note_354"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">354</span></span></a> Other letters followed in quick succession—on
the 24th and 31st January and the 8th
February—all couched in similar terms.<a id="noteref_355" name="noteref_355" href="#note_355"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">355</span></span></a> When,
however, he saw how hopeless his case was, Edward
sent word to the mayor and sheriffs that the barons
might be admitted provided the city was still held for
the king. Accordingly the barons were admitted
without bloodshed, and held consultation at St. Paul's
as to what was best to be done.<a id="noteref_356" name="noteref_356" href="#note_356"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">356</span></span></a> Gaveston's days
were numbered. On the 12th June he was forced to<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc85" id="toc85"></a>
surrender unconditionally to the Earl of Warwick,
and that day week was beheaded without the semblance
of a trial.<a id="noteref_357" name="noteref_357" href="#note_357"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">357</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The influence he had exercised over the king had
been remarkable from their youth. The son of a
Gascon knight, he had been brought up with Edward
as his foster brother and playfellow, and in course of
time the strong will of the favourite gained a complete
mastery over the weaker will of the prince. But his
arrogant behaviour soon raised such a storm among
the nobles at Court that he was forced to leave
England. When Edward succeeded to the throne, one
of his first acts was to recall Gaveston, to whom he
gave his own niece in marriage, after having bestowed
upon him the Earldom of Cornwall. The king seemed
never tired of heaping wealth upon his friend. Among
other things, he bestowed upon his favourite (28th
Aug., 1309) the sum of 100 shillings payable out of
the rent of £50 due from the citizens of London for
Oueenhithe, to be held by him, his wife, and the heirs
of their bodies.<a id="noteref_358" name="noteref_358" href="#note_358"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">358</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Both of them had friends and enemies in
common. As Prince of Wales, Edward had made
an attempt to encroach upon some woods belonging
to Walter Langton, Bishop of Chester. This caused
a breach between father and son, and the prince
was banished from Court for a whole half-year.
Gaveston also bore the same bishop a grudge, for
it was owing in a great measure to Langton's influence
as treasurer to Edward I that he was in the first
instance forced into exile. When the prince succeeded<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span><a name="Pg138" id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
his father, there came a day of retribution for the
bishop; his property was handed over to Gaveston,
and he himself carried prisoner from castle to castle
by the now all powerful favourite. A proclamation
was also issued at the instance of Gaveston, inviting
complaints against the bishop.<a id="noteref_359" name="noteref_359" href="#note_359"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">359</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Edward had purposed holding a parliament at
Lincoln towards the end of July, 1312, but the turn
that affairs had taken induced him to change his mind,
and he summoned it to meet at Westminster.<a id="noteref_360" name="noteref_360" href="#note_360"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">360</span></span></a> It was
important that he should secure the city, if possible,
in his favour. In this he was successful; so that
when the barons appeared to threaten London, having
arrived with a large force at Ware, they found the
city's gates strongly guarded.<a id="noteref_361" name="noteref_361" href="#note_361"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">361</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In November (1312), the queen gave birth to a
son, who afterwards ascended the throne as Edward III.
Isabel herself informed the citizens of the auspicious
event by letter sent by the hands of John de Falaise,
her "taillur."<a id="noteref_362" name="noteref_362" href="#note_362"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">362</span></span></a> The news had already reached the
city, however, before the queen's own messenger
arrived, and he signified his disappointment at being
forestalled by declining to accept a sum of £10 and a
silver cup of 32 ozs., which the city offered him by
way of gratuity, as being inadequate to his deserts.
As nothing further is recorded of the matter, it is
probable that the offended tailor had reason to repent
of his folly. For more than a week the city was
given up to merry-making, in honour of the birth of<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page139">[pg 139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc86" id="toc86"></a>
an heir to the crown. The conduits ran with wine;
a solemn mass was sung at St. Paul's, and the mayor
and aldermen rode in state to Westminster, accompanied
by members of the fraternities of drapers,
mercers, and vintners of London, in their respective
liveries, to make offering, returning to dine at the
Guildhall, which was hung with tapestry as befitted
the occasion.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After the death of Gaveston, his old enemy
Walter Langton again found favour and resumed his
office as treasurer. The city had little reason to be
gratified at his return to power; for it was by his
advice that the king in December of this year (1312),
issued orders for a talliage, which the great towns,
and especially London, objected to pay. Early in the
following January (1313), the mayor and aldermen
were summoned to attend the royal council, sitting at
the house of the White Friars. The question was
there put to them—would they make fine for the
talliage, or be assessed by poll on their rents and
chattels? Before making answer, the mayor and
aldermen desired to consult the commons of the city.
An adjournment accordingly took place for that
purpose. When next the mayor and aldermen
appeared before the council, they resisted the talliage
on the following grounds:<a id="noteref_363" name="noteref_363" href="#note_363"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">363</span></span></a>—In the first place, because,
although the king might talliage cities and boroughs
that were of his demesne, he could not, as they
understood, talliage the City of London, which
enjoyed exemption from such an imposition by
charter. In the next place, there were prelates and
barons, besides citizens, who enjoyed rents and<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg 140]</span><a name="Pg140" id="Pg140" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
tenements in the city, and their consent would first
have to be obtained before the municipal authorities
could levy such a tax. Thirdly, the citizens held the
city by grant of former kings, at a fee ferm for all
services payable into the exchequer, and on that
account ought not to be talliaged. Under these circumstances
the council was asked to delay the talliage
until Parliament should meet.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This request the king and council expressed
themselves as ready to comply with on condition that
the city made an immediate advance of 2,000 marks.
The city refused, and the king's assessors appeared at
the Guildhall, and read their commission. They were
on the point of commencing work, when the city
obtained a respite until the meeting of Parliament
by a loan of £1,000. More than eighteen months
elapsed, and at last a Parliament was summoned to
meet at York (Sept. 1314); but the country was
in such a disturbed state, owing to the renewal of
the war with Scotland, that the talliage question was
not discussed. Nevertheless the king's officers
appeared again in the city to make an assessment,
and again they were bought off by another loan of
£400. The king took the money and broke his word,
and the record of pledges taken from citizens for
"arrears of divers talliages and not redeemed," is
significant of the hardship inflicted by this illegal
exaction on a large number of inhabitants of the city.<a id="noteref_364" name="noteref_364" href="#note_364"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">364</span></span></a></p>

3<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">s.</span></span> 4<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d.</span></span>), was allowed the city for the purpose of

arbalesters, fully equipped for the defence of Berwick.
Edward had been defeated by the Scots at Bannockburn
(24 June, 1314), and Berwick was threatened.
On the 21st November, Edward wrote from Northampton,
asking for 300 arbalesters if the city could
provide so many; but the city could do no more
than furnish him with 120.<a id="noteref_365" name="noteref_365" href="#note_365"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">365</span></span></a> The fall of Berwick was
only postponed. In 1318 the great border fortress
against Scotland was captured by Bruce. Edward was
forced soon afterwards to come to terms with the
Earl of Lancaster and the barons with whom he
had so long been in avowed antagonism, and a general
pacification ensued, which received the sanction of
Parliament sitting at York in November.<a id="noteref_366" name="noteref_366" href="#note_366"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">366</span></span></a> On the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was not long before the king and Lancaster
were preparing to join forces for the recovery of
Berwick. In the meantime, the Barons of the
Exchequer appeared at the Guildhall (25th February,
1319), and summoned the mayor, sheriffs and aldermen
to answer for certain trespasses. Several holders
of office, and among them Edmund le Lorimer, Gaoler
of Newgate, for whom Hugh le Despenser had solicited
the Small Beam, were deposed: a proceeding
which gave rise to much bickering between mayor,
aldermen and commons. Disputes, moreover, had
arisen in the city touching the election and removal
of the mayor, sheriffs and aldermen of the city, which<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page142">[pg 142]</span><a name="Pg142" id="Pg142" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to the writer of the French Chronicle,
to which reference has frequently been made,<a id="noteref_369" name="noteref_369" href="#note_369"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">369</span></span></a> the
dissension in the city was mainly attributable to John
de Wengrave, the mayor. The citizens had lately been
busy drawing up certain "points" for a new charter.
Wengrave, who was at the time, or until quite recently,
the city's Recorder, had contrived, in 1318, to force
himself into the mayoralty having served as mayor
the two years preceding—"against the will of the
commons." He had shown no little opposition to
the "points" of the proposed charter, possibly because
one of the points precluded the mayor, for the time
being, from drawing or hearing pleas, saving only
"those pleas which, as mayor, he ought to hear,
according to the custom of the city."<a id="noteref_370" name="noteref_370" href="#note_370"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">370</span></span></a> If this
received the king's approval, Wengrave's occupation
as Recorder, at least so long as he was mayor, was
gone. However this may be, the mayor's opposition
was rendered futile, and the articles were confirmed
by the king's letters patent.<a id="noteref_371" name="noteref_371" href="#note_371"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">371</span></span></a> Their main feature has
already been alluded to; thenceforth the direct way
to the civic franchise was to be through membership
of one of the civic guilds. A foreigner or stranger,
not a member of a guild, could only obtain it by
appealing to the full body of citizens before admission<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg 143]</span><a name="Pg143" id="Pg143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc88" id="toc88"></a>
through the Court of Husting. Conscious of their
newly acquired importance, the guilds began to array
themselves in liveries, and "a good time was about
to begin."<a id="noteref_372" name="noteref_372" href="#note_372"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">372</span></span></a> Edward did not give his assent to these
articles without receiving a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quid pro quo</span></span>. The citizens
were mulcted in a sum of £1,000 before the king's

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Early in 1321 commenced a memorable Iter at
the Tower which lasted twenty-four weeks and three
days. No such Iter had been held before, although
the last Iter held in 1275 had been a remarkable one
for the courageous conduct of Gregory de Rokesle,
the mayor. This was to surpass every other session
of Pleas of the Crown in its powers of inquisition, and
was destined to draw off many a would-be loyal
citizen from the king's side. Its professed object was
to examine into unlawful "colligations, confederations,
and conventions by oaths," which were known (or
supposed) to have been formed in the city.<a id="noteref_374" name="noteref_374" href="#note_374"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">374</span></span></a> The
following particulars of its proceedings are gathered
from an account preserved in the city's records and
supervised, if not compiled, by Andrew Horn, the
city's Chamberlain, an able lawyer who was employed
as Counsel for the city during at least a portion of the
Iter.<a id="noteref_375" name="noteref_375" href="#note_375"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">375</span></span></a> The annoyance caused by this Iter, the general

municipal business, is realised when we consider that<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg 144]</span><a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for six months not only the mayor, sheriffs and
aldermen for the time being, but everyone who had
filled any office in the city since the holding of
the last Iter—a period of nearly half a century—as
well as twelve representatives from each ward,
were called upon to be in constant attendance. All
charters were to be produced, and persons who had
grievances of any kind were invited to appear. Great
commotion prevailed among the citizens upon receiving
the king's writ, and they at once addressed themselves
to examining the procedure followed at former Iters.
It is probable, as Mr. Riley suggests, that for this
purpose they had resort to the "Ordinances of the
Iter" already mentioned as set out in the city's Liber
Albus.<a id="noteref_376" name="noteref_376" href="#note_376"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">376</span></span></a> When the dreaded day arrived and the
justiciars had taken their seat at the Tower, the mayor
and aldermen, who, according to custom, as already
seen in Rokesley's day, were assembled at the church
of All Hallows Barking, sent a deputation to welcome
them, and to make a formal request for a safe conduct
to the citizens on entering the Tower. This favour
being granted, the king's commission was read.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The opening of the Iter did not augur well for the
city. Fault was found, at the outset, by Geoffrey le
Scrop, the king's sergeant-pleader, because the sheriffs
had not attended so promptly as they should have done.
The excuse that they had only acted according to custom
in waiting for the grant of a safe conduct was held
unsatisfactory, and nothing would please him but that
the city should be at once taken into the king's hand.<a id="noteref_377" name="noteref_377" href="#note_377"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">377</span></span></a></p>

seemed to be getting forward when there arrived orders
from the king that the justiciars should enquire as to
the ancient right of the aldermen to record their
liberties orally in the king's courts. Having heard
what the citizens had to say on this point, the
justiciars were instructed to withhold their judgment;
and this and other questions touching the
liberties of the city were to be postponed for future

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the ninth day of the Iter, a long schedule,
containing over 100 articles upon which the Crown
desired information, was delivered to each ward of
the city.<a id="noteref_382" name="noteref_382" href="#note_382"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">382</span></span></a> Days and weeks were consumed in considering
various presentments, besides private suits
and pleas of the Crown. Suits were determined in
the Great Hall of the Tower facing the Thames,
whilst pleas of the Crown were heard in the Lesser
Hall, beneath the eastern tower. The justiciars
occasionally protracted their sittings till dusk, much
to the disgust of the citizens, whose business was<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg 146]</span><a name="Pg146" id="Pg146" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the thirty-fourth day of the Iter, John de
Gisors was indicted for having during his mayoralty
(1311-1313), admitted a felon to the freedom of the
city, and fraudulently altered the date of his admission.
The question of criminality turned upon this date. Had
the felony been committed before or after admission?
The accused declared in his defence that admission to
the freedom had taken place before the felony; a jury,
however, came to the opposite conclusion, and not
only found that admission had taken place after an
indictment for the felony, but that the mayor at the
time was aware of the indictment. The judges
therefore ordered Gisors into custody. He was soon
afterwards released on bail, but not without paying
a fine of 100 marks.<a id="noteref_384" name="noteref_384" href="#note_384"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">384</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A similar indictment against his son Anketin, as
having participated in his father's offence, failed.
Within a week of Gisors's indictment, the mayor for
the time being, Nicholas de Farndon, was deposed,
and the city placed in the hands of Sir Robert de
Kendale, the king's commissioner.<a id="noteref_385" name="noteref_385" href="#note_385"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">385</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For nine weeks in succession the citizens had
suffered from the inconveniences of the Iter, when a
brief adjournment over Easter took place. In the
meantime, an assay was held at the Guildhall of the
new weights and measures which Walter Stapleton,
Bishop of Exeter, had, in his capacity as the king's<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg 147]</span><a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc90" id="toc90"></a>
treasurer, caused to be issued throughout the country.
One result of the trial was that whilst the city's
weight of eight marks was discovered to be slightly
deficient, the city's bushel was found to be more true
than the king's.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After Easter the sittings of the justiciars were
resumed. A great change, however, had come over
them during the recess. They no longer behaved
"like lions eager for their prey; on the contrary, they
had become very lambs."<a id="noteref_386" name="noteref_386" href="#note_386"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">386</span></span></a> The reason for this sudden
change, we are told, was the insurrection in Wales,
under the Earl of Hereford, the king's brother-in-law.</p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">Andrew Horn appears as counsel for the City.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The chief questions discussed before the justices
were the right of the weavers of London to hold their
guild, and the right of the fishmongers of Fish-wharf
to sell their fish at their wharf by retail instead
of on their vessels or at the city markets. The claim
of the fishmongers was opposed by Andrew Horn,
himself a fishmonger by trade, as well as an eminent
lawyer, who acted on this occasion as leading counsel
for the City.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Whitsuntide was approaching, an indictment
was brought by the city wards against their old
enemy John de Crombwelle, the Constable of the
Tower. He had already made himself obnoxious to
the citizens by attempting to enclose a portion of the
city's lands;<a id="noteref_387" name="noteref_387" href="#note_387"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">387</span></span></a> and now he was accused of seizing a
small vessel laden with tiles, and converting the same
to his own use, and further, with taking bribes for<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
allowing unauthorised "kidels" to remain in the
Thames. The judges, having heard what he had to
say in defence, postponed the further hearing until
after Trinity Sunday (14th June). In the meantime,
the citizens had the gratification of seeing the
constable removed from office, for allowing the
Tower to fall into such a dilapidated state, that the
rain came in upon the queen's bed, while giving birth
to a daughter, afterwards known as Joanna of the
Tower,<a id="noteref_388" name="noteref_388" href="#note_388"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">388</span></span></a> and destined to become the wife of David

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the judges resuming their sittings after
Trinity Sunday, they sat no longer in the Great Hall
or the Lesser Hall, "as well by reason of the queen
being in childbed there, as already mentioned, as of
the fortifying of the Tower, through fear of the
Earl of Hereford and his accomplices, who were in
insurrection on every side." Temporary buildings
had to be found for them. A fortnight later there
were signs of the Iter being brought to an abrupt
termination, the citizens having represented that they
could not possibly keep proper watch and ward owing
to disturbances consequent to the holding of the
Iter;<a id="noteref_389" name="noteref_389" href="#note_389"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">389</span></span></a> and within a week, viz., on 4th July, it was

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was the bursting of the storm which had long
been gathering against the king's new favourites, the
Despensers, father and son, that caused the sudden
termination of the Iter, and it was the fear lest he
should lose the support of the city against Lancaster
and his allies that caused the king quickly to restore<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg 149]</span><a name="Pg149" id="Pg149" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc91" id="toc91"></a>

the place of the deposed Farndon.<a id="noteref_390" name="noteref_390" href="#note_390"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">390</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Within a few hours of the closing of the Iter
Chigwell and the aldermen were summoned to
Westminster to say whether they would be willing
to support the king and to preserve the city of London
to his use in his contest with the barons. Edward
and his council received for answer that the mayor
and his brethren "were unwilling to refuse the safe
keeping of the city," but would keep it for the king
and his heirs. They were thereupon enjoined to prepare
a scheme for its defence for submission to the
king's council, and this was accordingly done.<a id="noteref_391" name="noteref_391" href="#note_391"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">391</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The city was, however, wavering in its support;
Chigwell did his best to hold the balance between
king and baron, and to hold a middle course, avoiding
offence as far as was possible to one side and the
other. After the lapse of a few days, a letter came
from the Earl of Hereford, addressed to the mayor,
sheriffs, aldermen and commonalty of the city, asking
for an interview. It was then decided, after due deliberation
in the Court of Husting, to ask Edward's advice
on the matter before returning an answer. At first
the king was disinclined to allow the interview,
but when the lords approached nearer London, and
resistance would have been hopeless, he gave way,
and a deputation was appointed to meet the lords at
the Earl of Lancaster's house in Holborn. To them<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span><a name="Pg150" id="Pg150" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the earl explained the aim and object of himself and
his confederates. They were desirous of nothing so
much as the good of the realm and the overthrow of
the Despensers, father and son, who led the king astray
and had caused the Iter to be held at the Tower in
order to injure the city. Having listened to the earl's
statement, the recorder, on behalf of the deputation,
asked for a few days' delay in order to consult with
the mayor and commonalty. The matter was laid
before an assembly which comprised representatives
from each ward (30th July), and again it was resolved
to ask the king's advice. At length a reply was sent
to the lords to the effect that the citizens would
neither aid the Despensers nor oppose the lords, but
the city would in the meantime be strongly guarded
for the preservation of order. With this the lords
were satisfied.<a id="noteref_392" name="noteref_392" href="#note_392"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">392</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such popularity as the king had for a time
achieved by his concession to the demands of the
lords, however unwillingly made, was enhanced by
another circumstance. An insult had been offered to
the queen by Lady Badlesmere, who had refused to
admit her into her castle at Ledes, co. Kent, when on
her way to Canterbury. The queen was naturally
indignant, and the unexpected energy displayed by
Edward in avenging the insult gave fresh strength to
his cause. With the assistance of a contingent sent
by the citizens of London, the king beseiged the
castle, and, having taken it, hanged the governor.<a id="noteref_396" name="noteref_396" href="#note_396"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">396</span></span></a>

when occasion required. The battle of Boroughbridge
(16 March, 1322) was won for the king by the aid

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The king's triumph was destined to be short-lived.
In August, 1323, Roger Mortimer, a favourite
of the queen, effected his escape from the Tower,
where he had lain prisoner since January, 1322. The
divided feeling of the citizens which had been more
or less apparent since the year of the great Iter, now
began to assert itself. Mortimer's escape had taken<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
place with the connivance, if not active assistance, of
a leading citizen, Richard de Betoyne, and he took
sanctuary on the property of another leading citizen,
John Gisors.<a id="noteref_406" name="noteref_406" href="#note_406"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">406</span></span></a> In November the citizens thought fit
to close their gates, to prevent surprise.<a id="noteref_407" name="noteref_407" href="#note_407"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">407</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the following year (1324), a quarrel broke out
between two of the city guilds, the weavers and the
goldsmiths. Fights took place in the streets and
lives were lost.<a id="noteref_408" name="noteref_408" href="#note_408"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">408</span></span></a> How far, if at all, such a quarrel
had any political significance it is difficult to say, but
it is not unlikely, at a time when the guilds were
winning their way to chartered rights, that occasionally
their members took sides in the political
struggle that was then being carried on.</p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">Departure of the queen for France, 9 March, 1324.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Edward, in the meanwhile, was threatened with
war by France, unless he consented to cross the sea
and do homage to the French king for the possessions
he held in that country. This the Despensers
dared not allow him to do. A compromise was therefore
effected. Queen Isabel, who was not sorry for
an opportunity of quitting the side of a husband who
had seized all her property, removed her household,
and put her on board wages at twenty shillings
a day,<a id="noteref_409" name="noteref_409" href="#note_409"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">409</span></span></a> undertook, with the king's assent, to revisit
her home and to bring about a settlement.
Accordingly, on the 9th March,<a id="noteref_410" name="noteref_410" href="#note_410"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">410</span></span></a> 1324, she crossed
over to France, where she was afterwards joined by
Mortimer and her son.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Once on the continent, the queen threw off the
mask, and immediately began to concert measures
against the king and the Despensers. By negotiating
a marriage for her son with the daughter of the
Count of Hainault, she contrived to raise supporters
in England, whilst by her affected humility and
sorrow, displayed by wearing simple apparel as one
that mourned for her husband, she won the sympathy
of all who beheld her.<a id="noteref_411" name="noteref_411" href="#note_411"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">411</span></span></a> The king, on the
other hand, publicly forbade any one holding correspondence
with her, caused provisions to be laid up in
the Tower in case of emergency, and prepared a
fleet to prevent her landing.</p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">The City lost to Edward.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was all in vain. The majority of the citizens
had made up their mind to give him no more
support. On the 24th September, 1326, Isabel, in
spite of all precautions, effected a landing near
Harwich; and Edward, as soon as he was made
aware of her arrival in England, took fright and left
London for the west. The queen, who was accompanied
by her son and her "gentle Mortimer," gave
out that she came as an avenger of Earl Thomas,
whose memory was yet green in the minds of the
citizens, and as the enemy of the Despensers.<a id="noteref_412" name="noteref_412" href="#note_412"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">412</span></span></a> Adherents

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime a letter had been despatched to
the city in her name and that of her son, desiring its<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
assistance in destroying "the enemies of the land."
To this letter, we are told, no answer was sent
"through fear of the king." Another letter was therefore
sent to the same effect, in which Hugh Despenser
was especially named as one to be destroyed, and an
immediate answer was requested.<a id="noteref_414" name="noteref_414" href="#note_414"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">414</span></span></a> This letter was
affixed to the cross in Cheapside and copies circulated
through the city.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 15th October, the city broke out into
open rebellion. The mayor and other leading men
had gone to the house of the Blackfriars to meet the
Bishops of London and Exeter. The mob, now fairly
roused by the queen's second letter, hurried thither
and forced them to return to the Guildhall, the timid
Chigwell "crying mercy with clasped hands," and
promising to grant all they required. A proclamation
was made shortly afterwards to the effect that "the
enemies to the king and the queen and their son"
should depart the city.<a id="noteref_415" name="noteref_415" href="#note_415"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">415</span></span></a></p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">The murder of Bishop Stapleton, 15 October, 1326.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One unfortunate man, John le Marchall, suspected
of being employed by Hugh Despenser as a spy,
was seized and incontinently beheaded in Cheapside.
The mob, having tasted blood, hastened to sack the
house of Walter Stapleton, Bishop of Exeter, who as
Edward's treasurer, had confiscated the queen's property.
It so happened, that the bishop himself,
attended by two esquires, was riding towards the city
intending to have his midday meal at his house in Old
Dean's Lane (now Warwick Lane), before proceeding
to the Tower. Hearing cries of "Traitor!" he<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span><a name="Pg157" id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc95" id="toc95"></a>
guessed that something was wrong, and made for
sanctuary in St. Paul's. He was caught, however,
just as he was about to enter the north door, dragged
from his horse, carried to Chepe, and there put to
death in the same way as John le Marchall had been
executed a short hour before.<a id="noteref_416" name="noteref_416" href="#note_416"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">416</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The bishop's two attendant esquires also perished
at the hands of the mob. Their bodies were allowed
to lie stark naked all that day in the middle of Chepe.
The head of the bishop was sent to the queen at
Gloucester,<a id="noteref_417" name="noteref_417" href="#note_417"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">417</span></span></a> but his corpse was reverently carried into
St. Paul's after vespers by the canons and vicars of the
cathedral. It was not allowed, however, to remain
there long; for hearing that the bishop had died under
sentence of excommunication, the authorities caused
it to be removed to the church of St. Clement Danes,
near which stood the bishop's new manor house of
which we are reminded at the present day by Exeter
Hall. The parish church was in the gift of the
Bishop of Exeter for the time being, and John Mugg,
then rector, owed his preferment to Stapleton. He
was, therefore, guilty of gross ingratitude when he
refused to take in the corpse of his patron, or to allow
it the rites of burial. Certain poor women had more
compassion; they at least cast a piece of old cloth
over the corpse for decency's sake and buried it out of
sight, although without any attempt to make a grave
and "without any office of priest or clerk." Thus,
it remained till the following month of February,
when it was disinterred and taken to Exeter. The<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg 158]</span><a name="Pg158" id="Pg158" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
treatment of Bishop Stapleton caused other prelates to
look to themselves, and many of them, including the
primate himself, began to make overtures of submission
to Queen Isabel.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After the Bishop's murder there was no pretence
of government in the city. The mob did exactly as
they liked. They sacked the houses of Baldock, the
Chancellor, and carried off the treasure he had laid
up in St. Paul's. The property of the Earl of Arundel,
recently executed at Hereford, which lay in the
Priory of Holy Trinity, Aldgate, shared the same
fate. The banking house of the Bardi, containing the
wealth accumulated by the younger Despenser, was
sacked under cover of night. The Tower was entered,
the prisoners set free, and new officers appointed.<a id="noteref_418" name="noteref_418" href="#note_418"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">418</span></span></a>
All this was done in the face of a proclamation, calling
upon the citizens to sink their differences and to
settle their disputes by lawful means.<a id="noteref_419" name="noteref_419" href="#note_419"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">419</span></span></a></p>

paid a visit to the Guildhall, where, after receiving
the freedom of the city, and swearing "to live and
die with them in the cause, and to maintain the
franchise," he presented a letter from the queen,
permitting the citizens freely to elect their mayor as
in the days before the Iter of 1321, for since that time
no mayor had been elected, save only by the king's<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span><a name="Pg159" id="Pg159" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc96" id="toc96"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 13th January, 1327—exactly one week
before the king met his wretched end in Berkeley
Castle—Mortimer came to the Guildhall with a large

several bishops, and one and all made oath to
maintain the cause of the queen and of her son, and
to preserve the liberties of the City of London. This
was solemnly done in the presence of the mayor, the
chamberlain, Andrew Horn, and a vast concourse of
citizens. The Archbishop, who had offended many
of the citizens by annulling the decree of exile passed
against the Despensers in 1321, now sought their
favour by the public offer of a gift to the commonalty
of 50 tuns of wine.<a id="noteref_422" name="noteref_422" href="#note_422"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">422</span></span></a></p>

he succeeded to the throne. For the first three years
of his reign the government of the country was practically
in the hands of Mortimer, his mother's paramour;
and it was no doubt by his advice and that of the
queen-mother that the young king rewarded the
citizens of London, who had shown him so much
favour, by granting them not only a general pardon<a id="noteref_423" name="noteref_423" href="#note_423"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">423</span></span></a>

the objects of bitter hatred. Henry, Earl of Lancaster,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a name="Pg164" id="Pg164" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the king's nominal guardian, had grown weary of his
false position, and of serving only as Mortimer's tool.
Determined to throw off the yoke, he refused to attend
a parliament which met at Salisbury in October
(1328),<a id="noteref_441" name="noteref_441" href="#note_441"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">441</span></span></a> unless certain changes in the government and
in the king's household were first made. In the meantime,
Bishop Stratford of Winchester and Thomas,
Lord Wake, two of his supporters, had paid a visit to
the city and had endeavoured to rouse the citizens to
action. The king, hearing of this, wrote to the municipal
authorities for an explanation. They frankly
acknowledged, in reply, that the bishop had been in
the city for the purpose of discussing the ill state of
affairs, and themselves expressed a hope, amid vows
of the utmost loyalty, that the king would redress
the grievances under which the nation suffered.<a id="noteref_442" name="noteref_442" href="#note_442"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">442</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Instead of attending the parliament at Salisbury,
the earl marched in full force to Winchester. On the
5th November he wrote to the citizens from Hungerford,
to the effect that he had made known to parliament
his honourable intentions, but had received no
reply; that the parliament had been adjourned to
London; that he had been informed of certain matters
about which he could not write, but which the bearer
would communicate to them; and he concluded with

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The mayor of the city at this time was John de
Grantham. His election had taken place but recently,
and was the result of a compromise. Chigwell, who had
again been chosen mayor at the expiration of Betoyne's
year of office in 1327, was a decided favourite with the
citizens, notwithstanding a certain want of firmness of
character, and he was again put up as a candidate for
the mayoralty in October, 1328. He had enemies, of
course. Towards the close of his last mayoralty he
was ill-advised enough to sit in judgment upon a
brother alderman on a charge of having abused him
two years previously. During the troublous times of
1326, John de Cotun, alderman of Walbrook ward,
was alleged to have described Chigwell, who was
then mayor, as "the vilest worm that had been in
the city for twenty years," adding that the city would
know no peace so long as Chigwell was alive, and that
it would be a blessing if he lost his head.<a id="noteref_444" name="noteref_444" href="#note_444"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">444</span></span></a> After some
hard swearing on both sides, leading to the discovery
of bad blood existing between the informer and the
alderman, the charge was dismissed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the outset it appeared that Chigwell's reelection
was assured; but the city as well as the
country was in a disturbed state, and political reasons
may have led to an endeavour to force another candidate
in the person of Benedict de Fulsham over his
head. Be that as it may, it is certain that when
Chigwell's name was proposed to the assembled
citizens at the Guildhall, the cry was raised of
"Fulsham! Fulsham!" So high did party spirit run,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg 166]</span><a name="Pg166" id="Pg166" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that the election had to be postponed, and eventually
it was thought best that both candidates should be
withdrawn. This having been done, the choice of the
electors fell on John de Grantham, a pepperer.<a id="noteref_445" name="noteref_445" href="#note_445"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">445</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 8th November the new mayor despatched
a letter to the king, expressing the joy of the city at
the news of a proposed visit, and the prospect of the

might be assured of the city's loyalty.<a id="noteref_446" name="noteref_446" href="#note_446"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">446</span></span></a> Four days
later (12 November), Edward despatched a messenger
from Reading with a letter to John de Grantham,
bidding him cause a deputation to be nominated for
the purpose of proceeding to Windsor. The messenger
arrived late on Sunday evening, and the deputation
was to be at Windsor on the following Tuesday. A
meeting was therefore summoned on Monday, when
six aldermen and six commoners were nominated to
meet the king. On Thursday the deputation returned
and reported the result of the interview. It appears
that Edward had complained to the deputation of
armed men having left the city to join the earl at
Winchester. He was also desirous to know if the city
was in a proper state of defence and the king's peace
preserved therein. On these points the mayor endeavoured
to satisfy him by letter of the 18th
November. As to armed men having left the city
for Winchester, his majesty was informed that none
had so left with the knowledge of the municipal
authorities, and if any should be found to have done
so, they would most assuredly be punished.<a id="noteref_447" name="noteref_447" href="#note_447"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">447</span></span></a></p>

besought him that all measures of hostility between
himself and the barons might be suspended until
parliament should meet. The city became the headquarters
of the dissatisfied bishops and nobles. The
Sunday before Christmas, the pulpit in St. Paul's was

the arrival of the Earl of Lancaster. On New Year's

The futility of an attempt to form a confederation
soon became apparent. The city stood fast to the
king; some of the barons wavered, and nothing was
left to Lancaster but to make the best terms he
could. Edward had already offered pardon to all
who should submit before the 7th January, with certain
exceptions.<a id="noteref_453" name="noteref_453" href="#note_453"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">453</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now that the king, or rather, we should say,
Mortimer, was once more master of the situation, the
citizens who had favoured the constitutional party
became the objects of retribution. On Sunday, the
22nd January (1329), the mayor and twenty-four
citizens were ordered to meet the king at St. Albans.
They returned on the following Thursday with instructions
to see if the city was prepared to punish those
who had favoured Lancaster. No sooner were the
king's wishes made known, than an enquiry was at
once set on foot. On Wednesday (1st February), the
deputation returned to the king, who was then at
Windsor, to report the sense of the city; and on the
following Sunday (4th February), the king's justices
commenced to sit at the Guildhall for the trial of
those implicated in the late abortive attempt to overthrow
Mortimer. Three days were consumed in preliminary
proceedings; and it was not until Wednesday
(8th February) that the real business of the session
commenced.  By that time the king himself had<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span><a name="Pg169" id="Pg169" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc103" id="toc103"></a>
come to London, and had taken up his headquarters
at the Tower, having passed through the city accompanied
by his consort, the queen-mother, and many
of the nobility.<a id="noteref_454" name="noteref_454" href="#note_454"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">454</span></span></a> It does not appear that Mortimer
came with them.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among those who were brought to trial at the
Guildhall was Chigwell. He was accused of being
implicated in the abduction of the Abbot of Bury St.
Edmunds, and of feloniously receiving two silver
basins as his share of the plunder. Being convicted,
he claimed the benefit of clergy, and the Bishop of
London, after some delay, was allowed to take possession
of him on the ground that he was a clerk. His
life was thus saved and he was conveyed to the
episcopal prison amid general regret, although, as we
have already seen, he was not a universal favourite.
"Many said, he is a good man; others, nay, but he
deceiveth the people."<a id="noteref_455" name="noteref_455" href="#note_455"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">455</span></span></a> He was kept for some
months in honourable confinement at the bishop's
manor of Orset, co. Essex, and early in 1330 was admitted
to purgation. Thus encouraged, he hastened
once more to return to the city. He was still popular
with a large body of the citizens, who, on hearing of
his approach, flocked to meet him, his re-entry into
the city being made to resemble a triumphal progress.
Both Isabel and her son were seized with alarm; and
a writ was forthwith issued for his arrest.<a id="noteref_456" name="noteref_456" href="#note_456"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">456</span></span></a> He was,
however, forewarned, and able to make his escape.
Little is known of his subsequent career; Stow places
his death in or about 1328, but this must be a mistake.
By his will dated 1332, he left some real estate in the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg 170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mortimer's vengeance was not confined to a few
leading citizens. Lancaster's life was spared, but he
was mulcted in a heavy fine. Many of his associates
took refuge in flight. The Earl of Kent, the king's
uncle, was shortly afterwards charged with treason,
into which he had been drawn by the subtlety of
Mortimer, and made to pay the penalty with his
head. This, more than anything else, opened the
king's eyes to Mortimer's true character, and at length
(Oct., 1339,) he caused him to be privily seized in the
castle of Nottingham.<a id="noteref_458" name="noteref_458" href="#note_458"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">458</span></span></a> Thence he was carried to
London, and hanged at the Elms in Smithfield.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Queen Isabel, who witnessed the seizure of her
favourite and whose prayers to spare the "gentle
Mortimer" were of no avail, was made to disgorge
much of the wealth she had acquired during her
supremacy, and was put on an allowance. The rest
of her life, a period of nearly thirty years, she spent
in retirement. Before her death<a id="noteref_459" name="noteref_459" href="#note_459"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">459</span></span></a> she gave the sum
of forty shillings to the Abbess and Minoresses of
Aldgate of the Order of St. Clare, for the purpose of
purchasing for themselves two pittances or doles on
the anniversaries of the decease of her husband the
late king and of Sir John de Eltham his son.<a id="noteref_460" name="noteref_460" href="#note_460"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">460</span></span></a> The<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg 171]</span><a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc104" id="toc104"></a>
removal of Mortimer corresponded very closely with
the king's coming of age. He was now eighteen years
old, and thenceforth he "ruled as well as reigned."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The king's marriage with Philippa of Hainault,
which had taken place at York on the 30th January,
1328, had been popular with the city<a id="noteref_461" name="noteref_461" href="#note_461"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">461</span></span></a> as tending to
open up trade with Flanders. Hitherto nearly all the
wool produced by this country had been sent to
Flanders for manufacture, the export trade being so
large that the king is said to have received more than
£30,000 in a single year from duties levied on this
commodity alone.<a id="noteref_462" name="noteref_462" href="#note_462"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">462</span></span></a> We have already seen how, in
order to punish the Countess of Flanders for injuries
inflicted upon English merchants, the king's grandfather
resorted, in 1270, to the expedient of forbidding
all export of wool to her country.<a id="noteref_463" name="noteref_463" href="#note_463"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">463</span></span></a> The misery which
her half-starved people were then compelled to suffer
soon induced the Countess to come to terms. It was
also in no small measure owing to the fear of a similar
stoppage by the intervention of the French fleet, that
the Flemings laid aside their neutrality in 1339, and
openly assisted Edward in his war with France.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Towards the close of the last reign the "staples"
or market towns for the sale of certain commodities,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span><a name="Pg172" id="Pg172" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
but more especially of wool, had been removed from
the continent and established at various places in England,
Ireland and Wales.<a id="noteref_464" name="noteref_464" href="#note_464"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">464</span></span></a> London was one of those
places. No wool was to be exported abroad until it
had remained at one or another of the staples for a
period of forty days. This rule appears however to
have been relaxed by Edward II, in favour of all
staple towns but London; merchants being allowed to
remove their goods from other staples after a stay of
only fifteen days. The London merchants, therefore,
were under the disadvantage of finding the market
always forestalled. Edward III had not long been
on the throne before they took the opportunity of
submitting this hardship not only to the king, but
also to the queen-mother, and prayed that the relaxation
of the rule touching the forty days with respect
to other staples might be withdrawn.<a id="noteref_465" name="noteref_465" href="#note_465"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">465</span></span></a> Their prayer,
however, would seem to have had but little effect,
for within a week of the petition to the king we find
that monarch issuing an order to the collector of
customs on wool, leather and wool-fells in the port
of London, to enforce the delay of forty days before
goods could be removed.<a id="noteref_466" name="noteref_466" href="#note_466"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">466</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor was this the only grievance that the London
merchants had. In order to raise money to put down
the rebellion of the Scots which had broken out soon<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page173">[pg 173]</span><a name="Pg173" id="Pg173" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc105" id="toc105"></a>
after his accession, he had recourse to an extra tax
upon wool, leather, and wool-fells. The money thus
raised was to be considered a loan, receipts being
given to the merchants under the king's seal, known
as "Coket," and the merchants in return were to be
allowed absolute free trade from the 2nd July, 1327,
the date of the writ, up to the following Christmas.<a id="noteref_467" name="noteref_467" href="#note_467"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">467</span></span></a>
The Londoners objected altogether to this impost, on

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A compromise was subsequently effected. In
consideration of the good service which the citizens
of London had already done to the king in times
past, and for the good service which they were prepared
to render again in the future, they were released
of arrears of the tax due from 2nd July to the
23rd September, provided they were willing to pay it
for the remainder of the term.<a id="noteref_469" name="noteref_469" href="#note_469"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">469</span></span></a> After Christmas the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 11th December (1327), Edward issued a

however, of sending only two members as directed,

less than four, viz.: Richard de Betoyne, Robert de

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the questions to be determined was the
advisability of again removing the Staple from
England to the continent. On this question, there
appears to have arisen some difference of opinion
among the city representatives. Betoyne, who had
formerly enjoyed the office of Mayor of the Staple
beyond the seas, favoured a return to the old order of
things, whilst his colleagues were opposed to any
such proceeding. Notification of Betoyne's disagreement
with his colleagues was made to the mayor and
commonalty of the City by letter from the mayor
and commonalty of York, to which reply was made
that Betoyne's action was entirely unauthorised.<a id="noteref_473" name="noteref_473" href="#note_473"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">473</span></span></a> A

another to Betoyne's colleagues informing them of
the City's action, and bidding them to exert themselves
to the utmost to keep the Staple in England.<a id="noteref_475" name="noteref_475" href="#note_475"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">475</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The account of Betoyne's difference with his
colleagues, as related in the letter from the City of
York, was subsequently found to require considerable
modification, when a letter was received by the Mayor
of London from two of his colleagues, Grantham<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg 175]</span><a name="Pg175" id="Pg175" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc106" id="toc106"></a>
and Priour.<a id="noteref_476" name="noteref_476" href="#note_476"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">476</span></span></a> Their account of what had actually
taken place was to the effect that Betoyne had been
publicly requested by a number of representatives
from various towns, assembled in the Chapter House
at York, to resign his mayoralty (of the Staple) and
to deliver up the charters which had been acquired at
no little expense. Betoyne replied that the charters
were in the possession of John de Charleton,<a id="noteref_477" name="noteref_477" href="#note_477"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">477</span></span></a> who
refused to give them up, but that he had himself, four
years since, caused a transcript of the charters to be
made, which he was prepared to give up to them if
they so wished. Thereupon, there suddenly appeared
upon the scene the Mayor of York, hand in hand with
John de Charleton himself, and followed by a number
of burgesses of York. The appearance of John de
Charleton was eminently distasteful to Betoyne, and
he got up and left the room, declining to take any
further part in the discussion so long as Charleton was
present. That was practically all that had occurred,
and the writers expressed themselves as much hurt if
anything more than this had been reported from the
mayor and commonalty of York, for in their opinion
Betoyne had never shown himself otherwise than
diligent in his duty. The letter concluded with a
report of general news, the chief item being the
announcement of the death of the King of France, and
the writers expressed a wish that the same publicity<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg 176]</span><a name="Pg176" id="Pg176" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
might be given to their letter as was given to the
letter received from the Mayor of York.</p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">Betoyne's own account of his disagreement with his colleagues.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Betoyne on the same day sent home his own
account of what had taken place at York.<a id="noteref_478" name="noteref_478" href="#note_478"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">478</span></span></a> It agrees
in the main with the account sent by his colleagues,
but contains some particulars of interest not mentioned
in the latter. He relates how he had been
asked to retire from the Mayoralty of the Staple
beyond the seas, and to give up the charters and other
muniments which the several towns had obtained at
considerable cost. To this he had replied that many
charters he had left behind on the continent, but he
had brought over with him the charters of the franchises
of the staples which had been purchased of the
late king. These were in the hands of John de
Charleton, who refused to give them up. He had
himself, however, gone to Dover in the eighteenth
year of Edward II, when the king himself was there,
and had caused a duplicate of the charters to be made,
which he had expressed his readiness to show them.
He encloses a copy. As a proof of the bad feeling
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">la malencolye</span></span>) which the burgesses of York entertained
towards him, he proceeds to relate how the
Mayor of York, maliciously and without any warning,
had appeared at the assembly with four or five of his
suite, accompanied by John de Charleton, clothed in
the mayor's livery, and by a crowd of citizens, to
the terror of the assembled merchants. Thereupon,
Bretoyne had declared that he would not sit nor
remain where Charleton was, and had left the meeting;
for, said he, he would never make peace with
Charleton except with the assent of the Mayor and<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span><a name="Pg177" id="Pg177" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc107" id="toc107"></a>
Commonalty of London. He concluded by asking
that his character might not be allowed to suffer by
anything which the Mayor of York may have written.
By a postscript he informs the Mayor of London, that
on the eve of the Purification (the day fixed for the
re-assembly of parliament) the Mayor of York had
come to his hostel, accompanied by many others, and
had accused him of having come to the city for the
express purpose of annoying their fellow-burgess John
de Charleton, which he had denied. This insult, he
is advised, touches not only himself, but the Corporation
of London whose representative he was.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the last political acts of Mortimer had
been to send Edward over to France to do homage to
Philip of Valois, the new king, for his possessions in

was making preparations for war, and took the
opportunity of the presence of Stephen de Abyndone
and John de Caustone, the City's representatives in
the parliament held that year at Westminster, to ask
them what assistance the City would be likely to
afford him. The City members asked leave to consult
the commonalty on the matter. Eventually the
sum of 1,000 marks was offered, a sum so trifling
that Edward consented to accept it only as a free
gift, and plainly intimated that he looked for more
substantial aid in the future.<a id="noteref_484" name="noteref_484" href="#note_484"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">484</span></span></a></p>

Substitutes were appointed for the mayor during his

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From 1332 to 1335 the king was chiefly occupied
with Scotland. It was part of the policy of Philip of

England, as a means of recovering his lost possessions
in France.<a id="noteref_487" name="noteref_487" href="#note_487"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">487</span></span></a> The period of four years during which

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At length, the friendly attitude which Philip of
Valois had taken up towards Scotland, much to
Edward's prejudice, determined the latter to go in
person to France for the purpose, not only of defending
his possessions there, but also of enforcing his
claim to the French crown. The year 1337 was devoted
to active preparations for the struggle. The
City of London, in spite of its franchise, was called
upon to furnish 500 men at arms, and to send them
to Portsmouth by Whitsuntide.<a id="noteref_494" name="noteref_494" href="#note_494"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">494</span></span></a> The date was subsequently

occasion to find fault with the city's dilatoriness in
executing his demands, as well as with the physique
of the men that were being supplied. At the request
of the mayor, Sir John de Pulteney (he had recently

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In March, 1337, a statute forbade the importation

Thus in April, 1339, an assessment had to be made in
the several wards of the City to discharge a debt to
the king of 1,000 marks. The men of Aldersgate
ward refused to pay their quota of £9. A precept
was thereupon issued to the sheriffs to levy the larger

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He had come to the end of his resources and was
in want of money to carry on the war. The City was
asked to lend him £20,000. It offered 5,000 marks.
This was contemptuously refused, and the municipal
authorities were bidden to re-consider the matter, or
in the alternative to furnish the king with the names
of the wealthier inhabitants of the City. At length
the City agreed to advance the sum of £5,000 for a
fixed period, and this offer the king was fain to accept.<a id="noteref_521" name="noteref_521" href="#note_521"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">521</span></span></a>
At the close of 1339, the chief towns of Flanders had
entered into an offensive and defensive alliance with
Edward, and an arrangement was made for paying

(June, 1340). With him went a contingent of 283
men-at-arms, furnished by the City, 140 of them being
drawn from that part of the city which lay on the
east side of Walbrook, and 143 from the western side.
It had been intended to raise 300 men, and the better
class of citizens had been called upon to supply each
a quota, or in default to serve in person; but eleven
had failed in their duty and, on that account, had<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span><a name="Pg186" id="Pg186" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was one of the conditions of the Flemish
alliance, mentioned at the close of the last chapter,
that the campaign of 1340 should open with the siege
of Tournay, and it was with this object specially in
view that Edward had set out from England. After
his brilliant victory over the French fleet which
opposed his passage Edward marched upon Tournay.
Its siege, however, proved fruitless, and, disappointed
and money-less, he slipt back again to England and
made his appearance unexpectedly one morning at
the Tower<a id="noteref_528" name="noteref_528" href="#note_528"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">528</span></span></a> (30 Nov.).</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The king attributed the failure of the war to the
remissness of his ministers in sending money and
supplies. Scarcely had he landed before he sent for
the chancellor, the treasurer, and other ministers who
were in London, and not only dismissed them from
office, but ordered them each into separate confinement.
John de Pulteney was one of those made to
feel the king's anger, and he was relegated to the
castle of Somerton, but as soon as Edward's irritability
had passed off he and others obtained their freedom.<a id="noteref_529" name="noteref_529" href="#note_529"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">529</span></span></a>
A searching enquiry was instituted in the spring of<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span><a name="Pg188" id="Pg188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the following year (1341) as to the way in which the
king's revenues had been collected in the city.
Objection was raised to the judges holding their
session within the city and they sat at the Tower.
Great tumult prevailed, and the citizens refused to
answer any questions until the judges had formally
acknowledged the City's liberties. A special fund was
raised for the purpose of defending the City's rights.<a id="noteref_530" name="noteref_530" href="#note_530"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">530</span></span></a>
From the 5th March to the 17th March the justices
sat, and then an adjournment was made until the
16th April. On resumption of the session another
adjournment immediately took place owing to parliament
sitting at Westminster, and when the judges
should have again sat, the Iter was suddenly determined
by order of the king.<a id="noteref_531" name="noteref_531" href="#note_531"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">531</span></span></a> The king showed much
annoyance at the attitude taken up by the citizens,

to this enquiry, and endeavoured to procure the names
of the ringleaders.<a id="noteref_532" name="noteref_532" href="#note_532"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">532</span></span></a> Failing in this, and not wishing
to make an enemy of the city on which he largely
depended for resources to carry out his military
measures, he bestowed a general pardon on the citizens,
and promised that no Iter should be held at the
Tower for a period of seven years.<a id="noteref_533" name="noteref_533" href="#note_533"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">533</span></span></a></p>

the seas. The result of the interview was made
known to the citizens at a meeting held later on in
the same month. A further grievous burden (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">vehemens

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ships were probably wanted for conveying
forces over to Brittany under the command of Sir
Walter de Maunay, in the following year. The king
himself made an expedition to that country in October,
1342, having previously succeeded in borrowing
the sum of £1,000 from the citizens. He had asked
for £2,000, but was fain to be content with the lesser
sum, security for repayment of which was demanded
and granted.<a id="noteref_536" name="noteref_536" href="#note_536"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">536</span></span></a></p>

longbow and the cloth-yard shaft in the field of
battle. Hitherto he, like others before him, had
placed too much reliance on charges by knights on
horseback. What the longbow could effect, under
proper management, had been experienced at Falkirk
in 1298. It had proved a failure at Bannockburn in
1314 through bad strategy, but at Halidon Hill twenty
years later (1333) it was again effective. It was destined
soon to work a complete reform in English
warfare; and the yeoman and archer were to supersede
the noble and knight. The London burgess and
apprentice were especially apt with the weapon from
constant practice in Finsbury fields. Edward realised
the necessity of fostering the martial spirit of the
Londoners, and on one occasion (January, 1344)
invited the wives of the burgesses to witness a tournament
at Windsor, where they were entertained right
royally.<a id="noteref_538" name="noteref_538" href="#note_538"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">538</span></span></a></p>

Midsummer of 1344, as the king was soon to cross the

a fortnight after Easter. The men-at-arms, the horsemen,
and the archers, were to be ready by a certain
day on pain of losing life, limb, and property. On the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 26th August the battle of Creçy was won
against a force far outnumbering the English army.
The victory was due in large measure to the superiority
of the English longbow over the crossbow used
by the Genoese mercenaries; but it was also a victory
of foot soldiers over horsemen. The field of Bannockburn
had shown how easy a thing it was for a body
of horsemen to crush a body of archers, if allowed to
take them in the flank, whilst that of Halidon Hill
had more recently taught the king, from personal
experience, that archers could turn the tide of battle
against any direct attack, however violent. Edward
profited by the experience of that day. He not only
protected the flank of his archers, but interspersed
among them dismounted horsemen with levelled<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page193">[pg 193]</span><a name="Pg193" id="Pg193" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc117" id="toc117"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Flushed with victory Edward proceeded to lay
siege to Calais. His forces, which had been already
greatly reduced on the field of Creçy, suffered a further
diminution by desertion. The mayor and sheriffs of
London were ordered to seize all deserters, whether
knights, esquires, or men of lower order, found in
the city, and to take steps for furnishing the king
with fresh recruits and store of victuals.<a id="noteref_549" name="noteref_549" href="#note_549"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">549</span></span></a> By Easter

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In July (1347) the king was in need of more

both besiegers and besieged were reduced to sore
straits. At last it surrendered (4 Aug.). Edward
spared the lives of its principal burgesses at the intercession
of his queen, but he cleared the town of
French inhabitants, and invited Londoners and others
to take up their abode there, offering them houses at
low rents and other inducements.<a id="noteref_552" name="noteref_552" href="#note_552"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">552</span></span></a> A truce with

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In August, 1348, the pestilential scourge, known
as the Black Death,<a id="noteref_554" name="noteref_554" href="#note_554"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">554</span></span></a> appeared in England, and reached
London in the following November. The number of
victims it carried off in the city has been variously
computed,<a id="noteref_555" name="noteref_555" href="#note_555"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">555</span></span></a> but all conjectures of the kind must be
received with caution. All that is known for certain
is that the mortality caused a marked increase in the
number of beggars, and, at the same time, raised the
price of labour and provisions within the city's walls
to such a degree that measures had to be taken to
remedy both evils.<a id="noteref_556" name="noteref_556" href="#note_556"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">556</span></span></a> Besides the losses by death, the
population of the city and the country generally was
sensibly diminished by the flight of numbers of inhabitants
to the continent, with the hope of escaping
the ravages of the plague. The king's treasury
threatened soon to become empty, and the country
left defenceless, if this were allowed to go on unchecked;
he therefore ordered the sheriffs of London
to see that no men-at-arms, strangers or otherwise, left<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg 195]</span><a name="Pg195" id="Pg195" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc118" id="toc118"></a>

or ambassadors, without the king's special
order.<a id="noteref_557" name="noteref_557" href="#note_557"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">557</span></span></a> Pilgrimages to Rome or elsewhere were made
an excuse for leaving England, at a time when the
king's subjects could ill be spared. The king endeavoured
to limit this drain upon the population of
the kingdom by allowing none to cross the sea
without his special licence. The city authorities having
negligently executed his orders in this respect, received
a rebuke in October, 1350, and were told to be more
strict in their observance for the future.<a id="noteref_558" name="noteref_558" href="#note_558"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">558</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the night which ushered in New Year's day,
1350, an abortive attempt had been made by the
French to recapture Calais. This ill success rendered
Philip the more willing to agree to a further prolongation
of the truce with England. Notification of this
cessation of hostilities was duly sent to the sheriffs of
London.<a id="noteref_559" name="noteref_559" href="#note_559"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">559</span></span></a> Before the truce had come to an end

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The city had scarcely recovered from the ravages
of the late pestilence, before it was called upon (24
July, 1350) to furnish two ships to assist the king
in putting down piracy. These were accordingly
fitted out; the ship of Andrew Turk being furnished
with 40 men-at-arms and 60 archers, whilst that of
Goscelin de Cleve had on board 30 men-at-arms and
40 archers.<a id="noteref_560" name="noteref_560" href="#note_560"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">560</span></span></a> With their aid, Edward succeeded in
utterly defeating a Spanish fleet which had recently
inflicted much damage on the Bordeaux wine fleet,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page196">[pg 196]</span><a name="Pg196" id="Pg196" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

The citizens had further to submit to a

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1354 an exception was made by special
charter of the king in favour of the City of London,
and its sergeants were permitted to carry maces of
gold or silver, or plated with silver, and bearing the
royal arms. Ten years before the commons of
England had petitioned the king (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">inter alia</span></span>) not to
allow any one to carry maces tipped with silver in
city or borough, except the king's own officers. All
others were to carry maces tipped with copper only
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">virolez de cuevere</span></span>), with staves of wood as formerly.
The petition was granted saving that the sergeants
of the City of London might carry their mace within
the liberties of the city and before the mayor in the
king's presence.<a id="noteref_563" name="noteref_563" href="#note_563"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">563</span></span></a> This same year (1354), moreover,
the king with the assent of parliament had again
forbidden the carrying of gold or silver maces.
Thenceforth, maces were to be of iron, brass or
tin, or staves tipped with latten, and not to bear
representations of the royal arms, but the arms or
signs of the city using them. Again exception was
made in the case of London; two sergeants of the
City as well as of the City of York being permitted to
carry gold or silver maces, but they were not to be
surmounted with the royal arms. This led to a
humble remonstrance from the whole body of the
citizens of London, presented to the chancellor and<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg 197]</span><a name="Pg197" id="Pg197" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc119" id="toc119"></a>
the council by their mayor, Adam Fraunceys, and
within a month the charter above mentioned was
granted. That the charter originated or authorized
the title of "Lord" Mayor, as some have supposed,
is extremely improbable.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1355, all efforts to convert the truce into a
final peace having failed, war with France was renewed.
Edward was soon called home by fresh
troubles in Scotland. Having recovered Berwick,
which had been taken by surprise, and formally received
the crown of Scotland from Edward Baliol, he
prepared to rejoin his son, the Black Prince, in France,
and in March, 1356, ordered the city to furnish him
with two vessels of war.<a id="noteref_564" name="noteref_564" href="#note_564"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">564</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">News of the battle of Poitiers (19 September,
1356), and of the defeat and capture of the French
king, was received in the city by letter from the
Prince of Wales, dated 22nd October.<a id="noteref_565" name="noteref_565" href="#note_565"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">565</span></span></a> Again the
English longbow, combined with superior tactics,
gained the day. The prince, on his return, made a
triumphal entry into the city, passing over London
Bridge on his way to Westminster, with the captive
king and the king's son in his train.<a id="noteref_566" name="noteref_566" href="#note_566"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">566</span></span></a> The streets
were almost impassable for the multitude that
thronged them; and for the moment the citizens forgot
at what cost to themselves the victory had been
gained. A truce—a welcome truce—for two years
followed.<a id="noteref_567" name="noteref_567" href="#note_567"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">567</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Only a few weeks before the prince's return the
citizens had laid before the king a list of their
grievances and prayed for redress.<a id="noteref_568" name="noteref_568" href="#note_568"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">568</span></span></a> They had complained
of being charged taxes and talliages in excess
of any other of the commons. They had lent the
king at Dordrecht no less a sum than £60,000, and
had incurred further loss by the discrepancy between
the weight for weighing wool at Dordrecht and that
of England. They had lent the king further sums of
£5,000 and £2,000 on two separate occasions, which
had not been repaid. The sum of £40,000 had been
advanced to the king's merchants at Calais and elsewhere,
and this, together with other sums lent
(amounting to over £30,000), was still outstanding to
the grievous hurt of many citizens. They had, moreover,
been called upon to undergo more charges than
others with respect to the king's expeditions to Scotland,
Flanders and France, and in providing men-at-arms,
archers and ships, in aid of his wars. Nor did
their complaints stop here. The king's purveyors had
been accustomed to seize the carriages, victuals and
merchandise of citizens without offering payment for
the same, in direct contravention of the king's first
charter to the city. Owing, moreover, to deaths by
the plague, so much property had come into mortmain
that the city had become impoverished, and
one-third part of it rendered void of inhabitants.
These points they had desired the king to consider,
inasmuch as the city had always been loyal and peaceful,
setting an example to the whole country. The
petition wound up with the usual complaint against
the privileges allowed foreign merchants, and a request<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page199">[pg 199]</span><a name="Pg199" id="Pg199" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc120" id="toc120"></a>
that the king would grant them letters patent under
the great seal, such as they might show to the purveyors
whenever they attempted to take anything
without payment.<a id="noteref_569" name="noteref_569" href="#note_569"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">569</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After the expiration of the truce Edward again
set out for France. That country, however, had
suffered so much during the last two years at the
hands of freebooters, that Edward experienced the
greatest difficulty in finding sufficient provisions for
his army. Whilst he was traversing France in search
of a force with which to try conclusions in the field,
a Norman fleet swept down upon the south coast and
sacked Winchelsea. The news of this disaster so
incensed the king that he determined to march direct
on Paris. The Londoners, in the meantime, assisted
in fitting out a fleet of eighty vessels, manned with
14,000 men, including archers, in order to wipe out
this disgrace, but the enemy contrived to make good
their escape.<a id="noteref_570" name="noteref_570" href="#note_570"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">570</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At length Edward was induced to accede to the
terms offered by France, and the peace of Bretigny
was concluded (8th May, 1360). The terms were
very favourable to England, although Edward consented
to abandon all claim to the French crown.
King John was to be ransomed, but the price set on
his release was so high that some years elapsed before
the money could be raised, and then only with the
assistance of a few of the livery companies of the city,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg 200]</span><a name="Pg200" id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which showed their sympathy with the captured king
by contributing to the fund being raised for the purpose
of restoring him to liberty.<a id="noteref_571" name="noteref_571" href="#note_571"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">571</span></span></a> It was John's high
sense of honour that kept him in captivity in England
until his death in 1364. He had in fact been liberated
and allowed to return to France soon after the conclusion
of peace, on payment of part of his ransom,
hostages being accepted for payment of the remainder.
In 1363 one of the hostages broke his pledge and fled,
and John, shocked at such perfidy, returned Regulus-like
to England. Hence it was that he appears as one
of the four kings whom Picard, the mayor, entertained
that same year at a banquet, followed by play at dice
and hazard.<a id="noteref_572" name="noteref_572" href="#note_572"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">572</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The citizens now enjoyed a period of leisure which
they were not slow to turn to account. The years
which followed the peace of Bretigny, until war broke
out afresh in 1369, witnessed the re-organisation of
many of the trade and craft guilds. Some of these,
like the Goldsmiths, the Tailors or Linen-Armourers,
and the Skinners, had already obtained charters from
Edward soon after his accession, so had also the Fishmongers,
although the earliest extant charter of the
company is dated 1363. The Vintners date their
chartered rights from the same year; the Drapers from
1364; whilst the more ancient company of Weavers
obtained a confirmation of their privileges in 1365.<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span><a name="Pg201" id="Pg201" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc121" id="toc121"></a>
Minor guilds, like the Founders, the Plumbers, the
Fullers and others, had to content themselves with
the recognition of their ordinances by the civic
authorities alone between 1364 and 1369.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The king's favour was purchased in 1363 by a
gift of nearly £500, to which the livery companies
largely contributed.<a id="noteref_573" name="noteref_573" href="#note_573"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">573</span></span></a> The amount of each subscription
varied from half-a-mark to £40, the latter sum being
contributed by the Mercers, the Fishmongers, the
Drapers, and the Skinners respectively. The Tailors
subscribed half that amount, being outdone by the
Vintners, who contributed £33 6<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">s.</span></span> 8<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d.</span></span></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With the renewal of the war, a change comes over
the pages of the City's annals. The London bachelor
and apprentice is drawn off from his football and
hockey, with which he had beguiled his leisure hours,
and bidden to devote himself to the more useful pursuits
of shooting with arrow or bolt on high days and
holidays.<a id="noteref_574" name="noteref_574" href="#note_574"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">574</span></span></a> Once more we meet with schedules of

and public proclamation was made to the effect
that the spoils of France should belong to the captors
themselves.<a id="noteref_576" name="noteref_576" href="#note_576"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">576</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was an easier matter for the City to provide the
king with money than men. In 1370 it advanced a<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
sum of £5,000,<a id="noteref_577" name="noteref_577" href="#note_577"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">577</span></span></a> and in the following year a further
sum of £4,000, and more was subscribed by the
wealthier citizens, among whom were William Walworth,
who contributed over £200, Adam Fraunceys,
Simon de Mordon, and others.<a id="noteref_578" name="noteref_578" href="#note_578"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">578</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Still the expenses of the war exceeded the supply
of money, and resort was had to a new form of
taxation, by which it was hoped that a sum of
£50,000 might be realised. By order of parliament,
made in March, 1371, the sum of 22<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">s.</span></span> 3<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d.</span></span> was to be
levied on every parish in the kingdom, the number
of parishes being reckoned as amounting to 40,000.
It soon became apparent that the number of existing
parishes throughout the country had been grossly
miscalculated. There were not more than 9,000, and
the amount of assessment had to be proportionately
raised. It was necessary to summon a council at
Westminster in June, to remedy the miscalculation
that had been made in March. Half of the representatives
of the late parliament were summoned to meet
the king, and among them two of the city's members,
Bartholomew Frestlyng and John Philipot—"the
first Englishman who has left behind him the reputation
of a financier."<a id="noteref_579" name="noteref_579" href="#note_579"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">579</span></span></a> The mistake was rectified,
the charge of 22<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">s.</span></span> 3<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d.</span></span> was raised to 116<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">s.</span></span> and the city
was called upon to raise over £600.<a id="noteref_580" name="noteref_580" href="#note_580"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">580</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime the civic authorities had, in
answer to the king's writ,<a id="noteref_581" name="noteref_581" href="#note_581"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">581</span></span></a> prepared a return of the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg 203]</span><a name="Pg203" id="Pg203" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc122" id="toc122"></a>
number of parish churches, chapels and prebends
within the city.<a id="noteref_582" name="noteref_582" href="#note_582"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">582</span></span></a> It was found that within the city

thirty prebends, but only two of the latter were within
the liberties. There was also the free chapel of St.
Martin's-le-Grand, which embraced eleven prebends,
all within the liberty of the city, and there were,
moreover, two other chapels within the liberty.
Besides these (the return stated) there were none
other.</p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">The city as an ecclesiastical centre.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The bare fact that there existed over 100 parishes,
each with its parish church, within so small an area
as that covered by the city and its suburbs, is of itself
sufficient to remind us that, besides having a municipal
and commercial history, the city also possesses an
ecclesiastical. The church of St. Paul, the largest
foundation in the city, with its resident canons exercising
magnificent hospitality, was a centre to which
London looked as a mother, although it was not
strictly speaking the metropolitan cathedral. That
title properly applies to the Minster at Canterbury;
but the church of Canterbury being in the hands of
a monastic chapter left St. Paul's at the head of the
secular clergy of southern England.<a id="noteref_584" name="noteref_584" href="#note_584"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">584</span></span></a> Besides the
hundred and more churches there were monastic establishments
and colleges which covered a good fourth
part of the whole city. The collegiate church of St.
Martin's-le-Grand almost rivalled its neighbour the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page204">[pg 204]</span><a name="Pg204" id="Pg204" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
cathedral church itself in the area of its precinct. The
houses of the Black Friars and Grey Friars in the
west were only equalled by those belonging to the
Augustine and Crossed Friars towards the east; while
the Priory of St. Bartholomew found a counterpart in
the Priory of Holy Trinity. The church was everywhere
and ruled everything, and its influence manifests
itself nowhere more strongly than in the number of
ecclesiastical topics which fill the pages of early
chronicles in connection with London.<a id="noteref_585" name="noteref_585" href="#note_585"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">585</span></span></a></p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">The prosecution of the war, 1371-1375.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The war brought little credit or advantage in
return for outlay. In January, 1371, the Black Prince
had returned to England with the glory of former
achievements sullied by his massacre at Limoges, and
the City of London had made him a present of
valuable plate.<a id="noteref_586" name="noteref_586" href="#note_586"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">586</span></span></a> The conduct of the war was transferred
to his eldest surviving brother, John of Gaunt,
Duke of Lancaster. In 1372 the king himself set out

relief of Rochelle, and which is said to have cost no
less than £900,000, proved disastrous, and Edward
returned after a brief absence.<a id="noteref_588" name="noteref_588" href="#note_588"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">588</span></span></a> In 1373 the city
furnished him with a transport barge called "The
Paul of London." The barge when it left London
for Southampton was fully supplied with rigging and
tackle; nevertheless, on its arrival at the latter port,
it was found to be so deficient in equipment that it<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg 205]</span><a name="Pg205" id="Pg205" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc123" id="toc123"></a>
could not proceed to sea. The only explanation that
the master of the barge could give of the matter was
that a certain number of anchors and cables had been
lost on the voyage. The City paid twenty marks to
make up the defects.<a id="noteref_589" name="noteref_589" href="#note_589"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">589</span></span></a> The year was marked by a
campaign under Lancaster which ended in the utmost
disaster. The French avoided a general action; the
English soldiers deserted, and as the winter came on
the troops perished from cold, hunger and disease.
By 1374 the French had recovered nearly all of their
former possessions. England was tired of the war
and of the ceaseless expenditure it involved. It was
with no little joy that the Londoners heard, in July,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Encouraged by the success which had so far
attended their efforts of reform, the good parliament
next attacked Alice Perers, the king's mistress. Of
humble origin, and not even possessing the quality of
good looks, this lady, for whom the mediæval chroniclers
have scarcely a good word to say,<a id="noteref_602" name="noteref_602" href="#note_602"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">602</span></span></a> nevertheless
gained so complete a mastery over the king as to

At length her barefaced interference in public affairs<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span><a name="Pg208" id="Pg208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
led to an award against her of banishment and forfeiture.
Upon the dissolution of the good parliament
(6 July, 1376), and the meeting of a new parliament,
elected under the direct influence of the Earl of Lancaster,
who once more gained the upper hand now
that the Black Prince was dead, Alice Perers was
allowed to return.<a id="noteref_603" name="noteref_603" href="#note_603"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">603</span></span></a> She was again in disgrace soon

which, under the name of Alsatia, became afterwards
notorious for riots, and as the resort of bad characters.

Lancaster. In so far as the duke, with the
assistance of Wycliffe, meditated a reform among the
higher clergy, he might, if he would, have had the
city with him. The citizens, like the great reformer
himself, were opposed to the practice of the clergy
heaping up riches and intermeddling with political
matters. The duke, however, went out of his way
to hurt the feelings of the citizens, by proposing to
abolish the mayoralty and otherwise encroach upon
their liberties.<a id="noteref_608" name="noteref_608" href="#note_608"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">608</span></span></a> Not content with this he took the
occasion when Wycliffe was summoned to appear at St.
Paul's (19 Feb., 1377), to offer violence to Courtenay,
their bishop. This so incensed the citizens that the
meeting broke up in confusion. The next day the
mob, now thoroughly roused, hastened to the Savoy
where the duke resided. He happened, however, to be
dining in the city at the time, with a certain John de
Ypre. The company had scarcely sat down to their
oysters before a soldier knocked at the door and
warned them of the danger. They forthwith jumped
up from the table, the duke barking his shins (we
are told) in so doing, and, making their way to the
riverside, took boat for Kennington, where the duke
sought protection in the house of the Princess of
Wales. Thanks to the intervention of the bishop,
who appeared on the scene, the mob did but little
serious harm, beyond ill-using a priest and some of
the duke's retainers whom they happened to come
across.<a id="noteref_609" name="noteref_609" href="#note_609"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">609</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The civic authorities were naturally anxious as to
what the king might say and do in consequence of
the outbreak, and desired an interview in order to
explain matters. Lancaster was opposed to any such
interview taking place. The London mob had seized
upon an escutcheon of the duke, displayed in some
public thoroughfare, and had reversed it by way of
signifying that it was the escutcheon of a traitor.<a id="noteref_610" name="noteref_610" href="#note_610"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">610</span></span></a>
This had particularly raised his anger. Nevertheless,
in spite of his efforts to prevent it, an interview was
accorded to a deputation from the city, of which John
Philipot acted as spokesman. After drawing the
king's attention to the threatened attack on the
privileges of the city, and the proposed substitution of
a "captain" for a mayor, Philipot offered an apology
for the late riot. It had taken place, he said, without
the cognisance of the civic authorities. Among a large
population there were sure to be some bad characters
whom it was difficult to restrain, even by the authority
of the mayor, when once excited. A mob acted after
the manner of a tornado, flying hither and thither,
bent on committing havoc at anybody's expense, even
its own, but, thank God! the duke had suffered no
harm nor had any of his retinue been hurt. The king
having listened to the deputation, assured them in
reply, that so far from wishing to lessen the privileges
of the city, he had a mind to enlarge them. They
were not to alarm themselves, but to go home and
endeavour to preserve peace. On leaving the presence
the deputation met the duke, with whom they interchanged
courtesies.<a id="noteref_611" name="noteref_611" href="#note_611"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">611</span></span></a> In the meanwhile lampoons on
the duke were posted in the city. The duke became<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc126" id="toc126"></a>
furious and demanded the excommunication of the
authors. The bishops hesitated through fear of the
mob, but at last the Bishop of Bangor was induced by
representations made to him by leading citizens, who
wished it to be known that they did not approve of
such libels, to execute the duke's wishes.<a id="noteref_612" name="noteref_612" href="#note_612"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">612</span></span></a></p>

again the citizens were summoned to appear before

not get off so easily. The mayor, Adam Stable, was

the City did penance for the recent insult to the duke's
escutcheon by offering, at the king's confidential suggestion,
a wax taper bearing the duke's arms in St.
Paul's. Even that did not satisfy him; nay, it was
adding insult to injury (he said), for such an act was
an honour usually paid to one who was dead! The
citizens were in despair, and doubted if anything would
satisfy him, short of proclaiming him king.<a id="noteref_614" name="noteref_614" href="#note_614"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">614</span></span></a></p>

reconciliation with Lancaster. This Richard promised
to do, and a few days later the deputation again
waited on the young king—this time at Shene, where

he proceeded in state to Westminster for his coronation.
Great preparations were made in the city to
tender his progress through the streets one of exceptional
splendour. The claim of the mayor and
citizens to assist the chief butler at the banquet was
discourteously refused by Robert Belknap, Chief Justice
of the Common Pleas, who bluntly told them that
they might be of service in washing up the pots and
pans. The citizens had their revenge, however.
They set up an effigy of the man at a conspicuous
arch or tower in Cheapside, in which he appeared to
the whole of the procession as it passed on its way to

wine.<a id="noteref_620" name="noteref_620" href="#note_620"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">620</span></span></a> This was enough; the Londoners gained the

raised to the throne. A council was therefore
appointed to govern in his name. Neither the Duke
of Lancaster nor any other of the king's uncles were
elected councillors, and, for a time, John of Gaunt
retired into comparative privacy. The task of the
council was not easy. The French plundered the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page214">[pg 214]</span><a name="Pg214" id="Pg214" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

was sorely needed. The City consented to advance

and when parliament met (13 Oct., 1377) it made a

was to be collected without delay, on the understanding
that two treasurers should be appointed to superintend

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lancaster soon became tired of playing a subordinate
part in the government of the kingdom. As<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page215">[pg 215]</span><a name="Pg215" id="Pg215" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc130" id="toc130"></a>
a preliminary step to higher aims, he contrived,
after some little opposition, to obtain the removal of
the subsidy granted by the last parliament, out of the

these men had given no cause for suspicion of dishonourable
conduct in the execution of their public

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The energetic John Philipot soon found other
work to do. The English coast had recently become
infested with a band of pirates, who, having already
made a successful descent upon Scarborough, were
now seeking fresh adventures. Philipot fitted out a
fleet at his own expense, and putting to sea succeeded
in capturing the ringleader,<a id="noteref_628" name="noteref_628" href="#note_628"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">628</span></span></a> a feat which rendered
him so popular as to excite the jealousy of the Duke
of Lancaster and other nobles. His fellow citizens
showed their appreciation of his character by electing
him to succeed Brembre in the mayoralty in October
(1378).<a id="noteref_629" name="noteref_629" href="#note_629"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">629</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The citizens were, however, split up into factions,
one party, with Philipot and Brembre at his head, maintaining
a stubborn opposition to Lancaster, whilst
another, under the leadership of Walworth and John
de Northampton, favoured the duke. These factions
were continually plotting and counter-plotting one
against the other. At Gloucester, to which the duke
had brought the parliament in 1378, in the hope of<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page216">[pg 216]</span><a name="Pg216" id="Pg216" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

Brembre was arraigned on a charge of having
connived during his recent mayoralty at an attack
made on the house of the duke's younger brother,
Thomas of Woodstock, Earl of Buckingham, and
although he succeeded in proving his innocence, the
earl and his party continued to use threats, and
Brembre, in order to smooth matters over, consented
to be mulcted in 100 marks. When the matter was
reported to the Common Council at home (25 Nov.),
that body not only signified its approval of his conduct—"knowing
for certain that it was for no demerits
of his own, but for the preservation of the
liberties of the city, and for the extreme love
which he bore it, that he had undergone such
labours and expenses,"—but recouped him what he
had disbursed.<a id="noteref_631" name="noteref_631" href="#note_631"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">631</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In course of time the earl and his followers succeeded
in persecuting Brembre to a disgraceful death.
At present they contented themselves with damaging
the trade of the city, so far as they could, by leaving
the city <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">en masse</span></span> and withdrawing their custom. The
result was so disastrous to the citizens, more especially
to the hostel keepers and victuallers, that the civic
authorities resolved to win the nobles back to the city
by wholesale bribery, and, as the city's "chamber"
was empty, a subscription list was set on foot to raise a
fund for the purpose. Philipot, the mayor, headed the
list with £10, a sum just double that of any other subscriber.
Six others, among them being Brembre (the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg 217]</span><a name="Pg217" id="Pg217" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The grants made to the king by the parliament
at Gloucester were soon exhausted by the war, and
recourse was had, as usual, to the City. In February,
1379, the mayor and aldermen were sent for to Westminster.
They were told that the king's necessities
demanded an immediate supply of money, and that
the Duke of Lancaster and the rest of the nobility
had consented to contribute. What would the City
do? After a brief consultation apart, the mayor and
aldermen suggested that the usual course should be
followed and that they should be allowed to consult
the general body of the citizens in the Guildhall.
Eventually the City consented to advance another
sum of £5,000 on the same security as before, but
any tax imposed by parliament at its next session was
to be taken as a set off.<a id="noteref_633" name="noteref_633" href="#note_633"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">633</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the session of parliament held in April and
May (1379), the demand for further supply became
so urgent that a poll-tax was imposed on a graduated
scale according to a man's dignity, ranging from ten
marks or £6 1<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">s.</span></span> 4<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d.</span></span> imposed on a duke, to a groat or
four pence which the poorest peasant was called upon
to pay. The mayor of London, assessed as an earl,
was to pay £4; and the aldermen, assessed as barons,
£2. The sum thus furnished by the city amounted
to less than £700,<a id="noteref_634" name="noteref_634" href="#note_634"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">634</span></span></a> and the whole amount levied on<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg 218]</span><a name="Pg218" id="Pg218" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the country did not exceed £22,000, a sum far short
of what had been anticipated.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the following year (1380) there was a recurrence
to the old method of raising money, but
this proving still insufficient a poll-tax was again
resorted to. This time, the smallest sum exacted
was not less than three groats, and was payable on
everyman, woman and unmarried child, above the age
of fifteen, throughout the country. The amount thus
raised in the city and liberties was just over £1000.<a id="noteref_635" name="noteref_635" href="#note_635"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">635</span></span></a>
The tax was especially irritating from its inquisitorial
character, and led to serious consequences.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The country was already suffering under a general
discontent, when a certain Wat Tyler in Kent struck
down a collector of the poll-tax, who attempted in an
indecent manner to discover his daughter's age. This
was the signal for a revolt of the peasants from one
end of England to the other, not only against payment
of this particular tax, but against taxes and
landlords generally. The men of Essex joined forces
with those of Kent on Blackheath, and thence
marched on London. With the aid of sympathisers
within the City's gates, the effected an entrance on
the night of the 12th of June, and made free with the
wine cellars of the wealthier class. The next day,
the rebels, more mad than drunk (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">non tam ebrii quam
dementes</span></span>), stirred up the populace to make a raid
upon the Duke of Lancaster's palace of the Savoy.
This they sacked and burnt to the ground. They
next vented their wrath upon the Temple, and afterwards
upon the house of the Knight's Hospitallers at<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page219">[pg 219]</span><a name="Pg219" id="Pg219" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc132" id="toc132"></a>
Clerkenwell. In the meantime reinforcements were
gathering in Essex under the leadership of one known
as "Jack Straw," and were hurrying to London. At
Mile End they were met (14 June) by the young king
himself, who set out from the Tower for that purpose,
accompanied by a retinue of knights and esquires on
horseback, as well as by his mother in a drawn
vehicle. The rebels demanded the surrender of all
traitors to the king. To this Richard gave his assent,
and having done so returned to the city to take up
his quarters at the Wardrobe, near Castle Baynard,
whilst the rebels, availing themselves of the king's
word, hurried off to the Tower. There they found
Simon of Sudbury, Archbishop of Canterbury, and he
and others were beheaded on Tower Hill. The rest
of the day and the whole of the next were given up
to plunder and massacre, so that the narrow streets
were choked with corpses. Among those who perished
at the hands of the rebels was Richard Lyons, the
deposed alderman. At length, on the evening of
Saturday, the 15th, when the king had ridden to
Smithfield accompanied by Walworth, the mayor,
and a large retinue in order to discuss matters with
Wat Tyler (the Essex men had for the most part
returned home), an altercation happened to arise between
Tyler and one of the royal suite. Words were
about to lead to blows when the mayor himself interposed,
and summarily executed the king's order to
arrest Tyler by bringing him to the ground by a fatal
blow of his dagger. Deprived of their leader the mob
became furious, and demanded Walworth's head; the
mayor, however, contrived to slip back into the City,
whence he quickly returned with such a force that the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg 220]</span><a name="Pg220" id="Pg220" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
rioters were surrounded and compelled to submit.
The king intervened to prevent further bloodshed,
and knighted on the field not only Walworth, but
also Nicholas Brembre, John Philipot and Robert
Launde.<a id="noteref_636" name="noteref_636" href="#note_636"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">636</span></span></a> The same day a royal commission was

entered the city, except those who declared on oath
that they were about to join the king's expedition

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">"Jack Straw," on being brought before the mayor,
was induced by promises of masses for the good of his
soul, to confess the nature of the intentions of the
rioters, which were to use the king's person as a<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page221">[pg 221]</span><a name="Pg221" id="Pg221" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc133" id="toc133"></a>
stalking horse for drawing people to their side, and
eventually to kill him and all in authority throughout
the kingdom. The mendicant friars, who were believed
to be at the bottom of the insurrection,<a id="noteref_641" name="noteref_641" href="#note_641"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">641</span></span></a> were
alone to be spared. Wat Tyler was to be made king
of Kent, whilst others were to be placed in similar
positions over the rest of the counties. The mayor
sentenced him to be beheaded. This done, his head
was set up on London Bridge, where Wat Tyler's
already figured.<a id="noteref_642" name="noteref_642" href="#note_642"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">642</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The discontent which had given rise to the
peasants' revolt, had been fanned by the attacks made
by Wycliffe's "simple priests" upon the rich and idle
clergy. The revolt occasioned a bitter feeling among
the landlord class against Wycliffe and his followers,
and after its suppression the Lollards were made the
object of much animadversion. Their preaching was
forbidden,<a id="noteref_643" name="noteref_643" href="#note_643"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">643</span></span></a> and Wycliffe was obliged to retire to his
country parsonage, where he continued to labour with
his pen for the cause he had so much at heart, until
his death in 1384.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The majority of the citizens favoured the doctrines
of Wycliffe and his followers and endeavoured to
carry them out. The Duke of Lancaster had no real
sympathy with the Lollards; he only wished to make
use of them for a political purpose. It was otherwise
with the Londoners, and with John de Northampton,
a supporter of the duke, who succeeded to the
mayoralty soon after the suppression of the revolt.
Under Northampton—a man whom even his enemies
allowed to be of stern purpose, not truckling to those<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page222">[pg 222]</span><a name="Pg222" id="Pg222" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
above him, nor bending to his inferiors,<a id="noteref_644" name="noteref_644" href="#note_644"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">644</span></span></a>—many
reforms were carried out, ecclesiastical as well as civil.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ecclesiastical courts having grossly failed in
their duty, the citizens themselves, fearful of God's
vengeance if matters were allowed to continue as they
were, undertook the work of reform within the city's
walls. The fees of the city parsons were cut down.
The fee for baptism was not to exceed forty pence,
whilst that for marriage was not as a general rule to
be more than half a mark. One farthing was all that
could be demanded for a mass for the dead, and the
priest was bound to give change for a half-penny
when requested or forego his fee.<a id="noteref_645" name="noteref_645" href="#note_645"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">645</span></span></a> Steps were taken
at the same time to improve the morality of the
city by ridding the streets of lewd women and licentious
men. On the occasion of a first offence, culprits
of either sex were subjected to the ignominy of
having their hair cropt for future identification, and
then conducted with rough music through the public
thoroughfares, the men to the pillory and the women
to the "thewe." After a third conviction, they were
made to abjure the City altogether.<a id="noteref_646" name="noteref_646" href="#note_646"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">646</span></span></a> It was during
Northampton's first year of the mayoralty that the
citizens succeeded in breaking down the monopoly of
the free fish-mongers. A number of "dossers" or
baskets for carrying fish were also seized because they
were deficient in holding capacity, and on that account
were calculated to defraud the purchaser.<a id="noteref_647" name="noteref_647" href="#note_647"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">647</span></span></a>  But,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page223">[pg 223]</span><a name="Pg223" id="Pg223" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc134" id="toc134"></a>
although a mayor in those days exercised, no doubt,
greater power in the municipal government than now,
we must be careful to avoid the common mistake of
attributing to the individuality of the mayor for the
time being what was really the action of the citizens
as a body corporate.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In October, 1382, Northampton was elected

His re-election was at the king's express wish. On
the 6th he wrote to the sheriffs, aldermen and commons
of the city intimating that, whilst anxious to
leave the citizens free choice in the matter of election
of their mayor, he would be personally gratified if
their choice fell upon the outgoing mayor. At first
Northampton declined re-election, but he afterwards
consented to serve another year on receiving a written
request from the king.<a id="noteref_649" name="noteref_649" href="#note_649"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">649</span></span></a> His hesitation was probably
due to the factious state of the city. Brembre and
Philipot were not his only enemies. Another alderman,
Nicholas Exton, of Queenhithe Ward, had
recently been removed from his aldermancy for opprobrious
words used to Northampton during his first
mayoralty. A petition had been laid before the Court
of Common Council in August, 1382, when Exton himself
being present, and seeing the turn affairs were
taking, endeavoured to anticipate the judgment of the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page224">[pg 224]</span><a name="Pg224" id="Pg224" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
court, by himself asking to be exonerated from his
office, declaring at the same time that he had offered
a large sum of money to be released at his election in
the first instance. The court wishing for further time
to consider the matter adjourned. At its next meeting
a similar petition was again presented, but the
court hesitated to pronounce judgment in the absence
of Exton, who was summoned to appear at the next
Common Council. When the court met again, it was
found that Exton had ignored the summons. Judgment
was, therefore, pronounced in his absence and he
was deprived of his aldermancy.<a id="noteref_650" name="noteref_650" href="#note_650"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">650</span></span></a></p>

of taking a leading part in the disturbance,
Brembre received a letter of indemnity from the
king.<a id="noteref_659" name="noteref_659" href="#note_659"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">659</span></span></a> The riot had one good effect. It roused
public opinion against monopolies and restriction of
trade to such an extent, that Richard very soon afterwards
caused the city to be opened freely to all
foreigners <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">(i.e.</span></span>, non-freemen) wishing to sell fish or

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In August (1384) the opinion of each individual
member of the Common Council was taken on oath,
as to whether it would be to the advantage or disadvantage
of the city if Northampton were allowed to
return; and it was unanimously found that his return<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page226">[pg 226]</span><a name="Pg226" id="Pg226" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
would breed dissension rather than peace and unity.<a id="noteref_661" name="noteref_661" href="#note_661"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">661</span></span></a>
Armed with this <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">plébiscite</span></span> the mayor and a number
of citizens, whom the king had summoned by name,
attended a council at Reading for the purpose of
determining the fate of Northampton. The accused
contented himself with objecting to sentence being
passed against him in the absence of his patron the
Duke of Lancaster. This, however, availed him
nothing, and he was sentenced to perpetual imprisonment
in Tintagel Castle.<a id="noteref_662" name="noteref_662" href="#note_662"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">662</span></span></a> Another authority<a id="noteref_663" name="noteref_663" href="#note_663"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">663</span></span></a> states
that the mayor brought with him to the council a
man named Thomas Husk or Usk (whose name, by
the way, does not appear in the list which the king
forwarded to the mayor), who made a number of
charges against Northampton. The prisoner so far
forgot himself in the royal presence as to call Usk a
liar, and to challenge him to a duel. Matters were
not improved by Northampton's appeal for delay in
passing sentence upon him in the absence of the
Duke of Lancaster. Richard flushed crimson with
anger at the proposal, declaring that he was ready to
sit in judgment upon the duke no less than on Northampton,
and forthwith ordered the latter's execution,
and the confiscation of his goods. The sentence would
have been earned out but for the timely intercession
of the queen, who flung herself at her husband's feet
and begged for the prisoner's life. The queen's prayer
was granted, and Northampton was condemned to
perpetual imprisonment and remitted to Corfe Castle.
Thence, at the beginning of September, he was removed<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page227">[pg 227]</span><a name="Pg227" id="Pg227" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc136" id="toc136"></a>
to the Tower of London, where two of his partisans,
John More, one of the sheriffs, and Richard Northbury,
recently arrested, were lodged.</p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">Is committed to Tintagel Castle.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Chief Justice, Tressilian, hesitated to take any
steps against the prisoners, one of whom had already
been tried and sentenced, asserting that the matter
lay within the jurisdiction of the mayor. His scruples,
however, on this score were easily set aside, and on
the 10th September, each of the prisoners was sentenced
to be drawn and hanged. No sooner was
sentence passed than the chancellor, Michael de la
Pole, entered on the scene, and proclaimed that the
king's grace had been extended to the prisoners, that
there lives would be spared, but that they would be
imprisoned until further favour should be shown them.
They were accordingly sent off to various fortresses;
Northampton to Tintagel Castle in Cornwall, Northbury
to Corfe Castle, and More to Nottingham; and
all this arose, says the Chronicler, from the rivalry of
fishmongers.<a id="noteref_664" name="noteref_664" href="#note_664"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">664</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Brembre sought re-election to the mayoralty
in October, 1384, he found a formidable competitor in
Nicholas Twyford, with whom he had not always
been on the best of terms. It was in 1378, when
Twyford was sheriff and Brembre was occupying the
mayoralty chair for the first time, that they fell out,
the occasion being one of those trade disputes so
frequent in the City's annals. A number of goldsmiths
and pepperers had come to loggerheads in
St. Paul's Churchyard during sermon time, and the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page228">[pg 228]</span><a name="Pg228" id="Pg228" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
mayor had committed one of the ringleaders to the
compter. The culprit, however, happened to be, like
Twyford, a goldsmith, and was one of his suite.
Twyford resented his man being sent to prison, and
for his pains got arrested himself.<a id="noteref_665" name="noteref_665" href="#note_665"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">665</span></span></a> It was felt that
the election would be hotly contested and might
lead to disturbance. Besides the customary precept
issued by the mayor forbidding any to appear who
were not specially summoned,<a id="noteref_666" name="noteref_666" href="#note_666"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">666</span></span></a> the king took the
precaution of sending John de Nevill, of Roby, to
the Guildhall to see that the election was properly
conducted. In spite of all precautions, however, a
disturbance took place, and some of the rioters were
afterwards bound over to keep the peace.<a id="noteref_667" name="noteref_667" href="#note_667"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">667</span></span></a> It is
said that Brembre himself secreted a body of men
in the neighbourhood of the Guildhall, and that
when he found the election going against him, he
signalled for them, and Twyford's supporters were
compelled to flee for safety, and that thus the election
was won.<a id="noteref_668" name="noteref_668" href="#note_668"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">668</span></span></a> Nothing of this appears in the City's

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1385 Brembre was again elected mayor, and
continued in office until October, 1386, when he was
succeeded by his friend and ally, Nicholas Exton.
This was the fourth and last time Brembre was
mayor. In the meantime, the Duke of Lancaster
and his party had renewed their efforts to effect the
release of Northampton and of his fellow prisoners,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page229">[pg 229]</span><a name="Pg229" id="Pg229" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc137" id="toc137"></a>
More and Northbury, on the understanding that they
were not to come near the City, and Brembre again
took the opinion of the aldermen and commons
severally as to the probable effect of the release of
the prisoners. This occurred in March, 1386, when it
was unanimously resolved that danger would result
to the city if Northampton was allowed to come
within 100 miles of it.<a id="noteref_670" name="noteref_670" href="#note_670"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">670</span></span></a> The resolution caused much

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A few months after Exton had taken Brembre's
place as mayor (Oct., 1386), the new mayor
raised a commotion by ordering a book called
"Jubilee," which Northampton is supposed to have
compiled—or caused to be compiled for the better
government of the City, to be publicly burnt in Guildhall
yard.<a id="noteref_673" name="noteref_673" href="#note_673"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">673</span></span></a> The cordwainers of London, staunch
supporters of Northampton (the leader of the riot
which led to Northampton's arrest in 1384 was a
cordwainer), complained to parliament of Exton.
The book, said they, " comprised all the good
articles pertaining to the good government of the
City," which Exton and all the aldermen had sworn
to maintain for ever, and now he and his accomplices
had burnt it without consent of the commons, to the
annihilation of many good liberties, franchises, and<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page230">[pg 230]</span><a name="Pg230" id="Pg230" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1387 efforts were again made to secure
Northampton's release, and this time with success.
On the 17th April Exton reported to the Common
Council that Lord Zouche was actually engaged in
canvassing the king for the release of Northampton
and his allies. The Council thereupon unanimously
resolved to send a letter to Lord Zouche, on behalf
of the entire commonalty of the City, praying him to
desist from his suit, and assuring him of their loyalty
to the king even unto death.<a id="noteref_676" name="noteref_676" href="#note_676"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">676</span></span></a> It also resolved to
send a deputation on horseback to the king, who was
at "Esthamstede," to ask his favour for the City, and
to beg of him not to annul the charters which he had
already given to the citizens, more especially as touching
the release of the prisoners in question.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 4th May the Recorder, William Cheyne,
reported to the Common Council assembled in the
upper chamber of the Guildhall the result of the
interview with the king. The deputation had been
received most graciously, and the mayor had been
particularly successful in his speech, setting forth the
dangers that would inevitably ensue, both to the king
and to the city, if pardon were granted to Northampton
and his friends. The king had replied that he
would take good precautions for himself before he<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page231">[pg 231]</span><a name="Pg231" id="Pg231" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc138" id="toc138"></a>

the citizens had to be content. The answer was an
evasive one, if it be true, as one authority states,
that on the 27th April—the day on which the mayor
had informed the citizens of the intervention of
Lord Zouche—Northampton had received his pardon
and been restored to his property.<a id="noteref_678" name="noteref_678" href="#note_678"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">678</span></span></a> His friends remained
still unsatisfied, and plagued the king for

against any further entreaties being made to him on
the subject.<a id="noteref_679" name="noteref_679" href="#note_679"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">679</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Two days before the order for this proclamation,
the king was informed by letter of the nature of a
fresh oath of allegiance<a id="noteref_680" name="noteref_680" href="#note_680"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">680</span></span></a> that had been taken by the

was furthermore exhorted to give credence to what
Nicholas Brembre might inform him as to the state
and government of the city, since there was no one
better informed than Brembre on the subject.</p>

continue, as he would soon have good reason for paying
a visit to the city in person. He had heard that
the new sheriffs were good and trusty men, and he
expressed a hope that at the approaching election of a
mayor they would choose one of whom he could
approve, otherwise he would decline to receive the
mayor-elect at his presentation. He not only forbade
any further entreaties to be made to him touching
Northampton, More and Northbury, but commissioned
enquiry to be made as to their property in the city.
He was especially gratified to learn that, in accordance
with his request, they had appointed Thomas Usk (the
chief witness against Northampton) to the office of
under-sheriff, and promised that such appointment
should not be drawn into precedent. The citizens
were not slow to take the hint about the election of a
new mayor, and Exton was continued in office.<a id="noteref_682" name="noteref_682" href="#note_682"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">682</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Great discontent had arisen meanwhile in the
country at the lavish expenditure of the king, without
any apparent result in victories abroad, such as had
been gained in the glorious days of his predecessor.
A cry for reform and retrenchment was raised, and
found a champion in the person of the Duke of Gloucester,
the youngest of the king's uncles. At his instigation,
the parliament which assembled on the 1st
October, 1386, demanded the dismissal of the king's
ministers, and read him a lesson on constitutional
government which ended in a threat of deposition
unless the king should mend his ways. Richard was at
the time only twenty-one years of age. In the impetuosity
of his youth he is recorded as having contemplated
a dastardly attempt upon the life of his uncle,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page233">[pg 233]</span><a name="Pg233" id="Pg233" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc139" id="toc139"></a>
whom he had grown to hate as the cause of all his
difficulties. A plan was laid, which is said to have
received Brembre's approbation, for beguiling the duke
into the city by an invitation to supper, and then and
there making away with him, but the duke was forewarned.
The chronicler who records Brembre's complicity
in this nefarious design against Gloucester's life
also relates that Exton, who was mayor, refused to
have anything to do with it.<a id="noteref_683" name="noteref_683" href="#note_683"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">683</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before the end of the session, parliament had
appointed a commission, with Gloucester at its head,
to regulate the government of the country and the
king's household. This very naturally excited the
wrath of the hot-headed king, who immediately set to
work to form a party in opposition to the duke. In
August of the next year (1387) he obtained a declaration
from five of the justices to the effect that the
commission was illegal. On the 28th October he
sent the Archbishop of York and the Earl of Suffolk
into the city to learn whether he could depend upon
the support of the citizens. The answer could not
have been regarded as unfavourable, for, on the 10th
November, the king paid a personal visit to the city
and was received with great ceremony.<a id="noteref_684" name="noteref_684" href="#note_684"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">684</span></span></a> On the

proclamation to be made to the effect that he had
taken these same individuals under his own protection,
and that no one should harm them save at his
own peril. This protection was extended also to the
king's uncle, the Duke of Gloucester, and the Earls of

to his shaking off the fetters of the commission.
As soon as his intention was known, these five lords—who,
from having been associated in appealing against
Richard's counsellors, were styled "appellant"—hastened
to London, and drawing up their forces outside
the city's walls, demanded admittance. After some
little hesitation, the mayor determined to admit them,
defending his action to the king by declaring that they
were his true liege men and friends of the realm.<a id="noteref_692" name="noteref_692" href="#note_692"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">692</span></span></a></p>

deprecated any remarks made to the disparagement
of the lords. The lords and the bishops had been
indicted on an iniquitous charge, and there were some<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page236">[pg 236]</span><a name="Pg236" id="Pg236" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
among the citizens who had been similarly indicted,
but whether justly or unjustly he (the bishop) could
not say. That would be decided by parliament. In
the meantime they were ready to assist in settling the
trade disputes in the city, for it was absurd for one
body of the citizens to attempt to exterminate another.
The citizens, however, showed no desire to accept the
proffered mediation.<a id="noteref_693" name="noteref_693" href="#note_693"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">693</span></span></a></p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">Trial of Brembre before parliament, Feb., 1388.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When parliament met (3 Feb.), a formidable
indictment of thirty-nine charges was laid against
the king's late advisers, of whom Brembre alone
appeared. On the 17th February, he was brought up
by the constable of the Tower, and was called on to
answer off-hand the several charges of treason alleged
against him. He prayed for time to take counsel's
advice. This being refused, he claimed to support his
cause by wager of battle, and immediately the whole
company of lords, knights, esquires, and commons,
flung down their gages so thick, we are told, that they
"seemed like snow on a winter's day."<a id="noteref_694" name="noteref_694" href="#note_694"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">694</span></span></a> But the
lords declared that wager by battle did not lie in such
a case. When the trial was resumed on the following
day, so much opposition arose between the king, who
spoke strongly in Brembre's favour, and the lords,
that it was decided to leave the question of the
prisoner's guilt or innocence to a commission of lords,
who, to the surprise and annoyance of the majority
of the nobles, brought in a verdict of not guilty.
Brembre was not to be allowed thus to escape. The
lords sent for two representatives of the various crafts
of the city to depose as to Brembre's guilt; but even<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page237">[pg 237]</span><a name="Pg237" id="Pg237" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
so, the lords failed to get any definite verdict. At
last they sent for the mayor, recorder, and some of
the aldermen (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">seniores</span></span>) to learn what they had to say
about the accused.</p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">Conviction and sentence of death.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One would have thought that with Nicholas
Exton, his old friend and ally, to speak up for him,
Brembre's life would now at least be saved, even if
he were not altogether acquitted. It was not so,
however. The mayor and aldermen were asked as
to their <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">opinion</span></span> (not as to their knowledge), whether
Brembre was cognisant of certain matters, and they
gave it as their <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">opinion</span></span> that Brembre was more
likely to have been cognisant of them than not.
Turning then to the Recorder, the lords asked him
how stood the law in such a case? To which he
replied, that a man who knew such things as were
laid to Brembre's charge, and knowing them failed to
reveal them, deserved death. On such evidence as
this, Brembre was convicted on the 20th February,
and condemned to be executed.<a id="noteref_695" name="noteref_695" href="#note_695"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">695</span></span></a> He was drawn on a
hurdle through the city to Tyburn, showing himself
very penitent and earnestly desiring all persons to pray
for him. At the last moment he confessed that his
conduct towards Northampton had been vile and
wicked. Whilst craving pardon of Northampton's
son "he was suddenly turned off, and the executioner
cutting his throat, he died."<a id="noteref_696" name="noteref_696" href="#note_696"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">696</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we are to believe all that Walsingham records of
Brembre, the character and conduct of the city alderman
and ex-mayor was bad indeed. Besides conniving
at the plot laid against Gloucester's life, which<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page238">[pg 238]</span><a name="Pg238" id="Pg238" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
involved the grossest breach of hospitality, he is
recorded as having lain in wait with an armed force
at the Mews near Charing Cross, to intercept and
massacre the lords on their way to Westminster, to
effect an arrangement with the king, as well as having
entertained the idea of cutting the throats of a number
of his fellow-citizens, and placing himself at the head
of the government of the city, the name of which he
proposed changing to that of "Little Troy."<a id="noteref_697" name="noteref_697" href="#note_697"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">697</span></span></a></p>

during the trial, torn from the Sanctuary at Westminster,
and hanged on the 19th. Another to share
the same fate was Thomas Uske, who had been one
of the chief witnesses against Northampton. He was
sentenced to death by parliament on the 4th March,
and died asseverating to the last that he had done
Northampton no injury, but that every word he had
deposed against him the year before was absolutely
true.<a id="noteref_698" name="noteref_698" href="#note_698"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">698</span></span></a></p>

called it, being ratified by oath administered to
prelates, knights, and nobles of the realm, as well as
to the mayor, aldermen, and chief burgesses of every

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime the continued jealousy existing
among the city guilds—the Mercers, Goldsmiths,
Drapers, and others, objecting to Fishmongers and
Vintners taking any part in the government of the
city on the ground that they were victuallers, and as
such forbidden by an ordinance passed when
Northampton was mayor to hold any municipal
office<a id="noteref_700" name="noteref_700" href="#note_700"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">700</span></span></a>—had led parliament (14 May) to proclaim free

tried to get parliament to remove Exton from the
mayoralty on the ground of his having connived at
the curtailment of the City's liberties and franchises.
The attempt, however, failed, and he remained in
office until succeeded by Nicholas Twyford (Oct.,
1388).<a id="noteref_702" name="noteref_702" href="#note_702"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">702</span></span></a> Although Twyford belonged to the party of
Northampton as distinguished from that of Brembre
and Exton, his election raised little or no opposition,
such as had been anticipated. When he went out of
office in October, 1389, however, party strife in the
city again showed itself. The majority of the citizens
voted William Venour, a grocer, into the
mayoralty, but the choice was strongly opposed by
the Goldsmiths, the Mercers, and the Drapers, who
ran another candidate, one of their own body, Adam
Bamme, a goldsmith.<a id="noteref_703" name="noteref_703" href="#note_703"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">703</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some months before the close of Twyford's
mayoralty, Richard had succeeded in gaining his
independence (May, 1389), which he was induced by
Lancaster, on his return after a prolonged absence
abroad, to exercise at length in favour of Northampton,
by permitting him once more to return to London,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page240">[pg 240]</span><a name="Pg240" id="Pg240" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
although only as a stranger.<a id="noteref_704" name="noteref_704" href="#note_704"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">704</span></span></a> This was in July.

His re-appearance in the streets of the city revived
the old party spirit, and Adam Bamme, who had
succeeded Venour in the mayoralty, found it expedient
to forbid all discussion of the rights and the
wrongs of the several parties of Northampton and
Brembre on pain of imprisonment.<a id="noteref_706" name="noteref_706" href="#note_706"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">706</span></span></a> Four more

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For some years Richard governed not unwisely.
In 1392, however, he quarrelled with the city. Early
in that year he called upon every inhabitant, whose
property for the last three years was worth £40 in
land or rent, to take upon himself the honour of
knighthood. The sheriffs, Henry Vanner and John
Shadworth, made a return that all tenements and
rents in the city were held of the king <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in capite</span></span> as
fee burgage at a fee farm (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ad feodi firmam</span></span>); that
by reason of the value of tenements varying from
time to time, and many of them requiring repair from
damage by fire and tempest, their true annual value
could not be ascertained, and that, therefore, it was
impossible to make a return of those who possessed
£40 of land or rent as desired.<a id="noteref_708" name="noteref_708" href="#note_708"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">708</span></span></a></p>

offended with the city. Being in want of money, he
had offered a valuable jewel to the citizens as security
for a loan, and the citizens had excused themselves on
the plea that they were not so well off as they used
to be, since foreigners had been allowed to enjoy the
same privileges in the city as themselves. Having
failed in this quarter, the king had resorted to a
Lombard, who soon was able to accommodate him;
but when the king learnt on enquiry that the money so
obtained had been advanced to the Lombard merchant
by the very citizens who had refused to lend it
to the king himself, his anger knew no bounds,<a id="noteref_709" name="noteref_709" href="#note_709"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">709</span></span></a> and

accordingly set out on their journey on the 19th June,
and arrived in Nottingham on the 23rd; the government
of the city being left in the meanwhile in the
hands of William Staundon. On the 25th they appeared
before the lords of the council, when the
chancellor rated them roundly for paying so little
attention to the king's writ—the writ touching knighthood—and
complained of the defective manner in
which the city was governed.<a id="noteref_711" name="noteref_711" href="#note_711"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">711</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Once more restored to their liberties, the citizens
in the following year (1393), with the assent of parliament,
effected a reform in the internal government

population that it was deemed advisable to divide it
into two parts, each part having its own alderman.
Accordingly, in the following March (1394), Drew
Barantyn was elected Alderman of Farringdon Within,
whilst John Fraunceys was elected for Farringdon
Without. A more important reform effected at the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A crisis was fast approaching. The Duke of
Hereford, whom the king had banished, and who, on
the death of his father "time honoured Lancaster,"
succeeded to the title early in 1399, was prevailed
upon to return to England and strike a blow for the
recovery of his inheritance which Richard had seized.
Richard, as if infatuated, took this inopportune<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page245">[pg 245]</span><a name="Pg245" id="Pg245" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
moment to sail to Ireland. Before setting out he

Henry of Lancaster.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As soon as Henry had landed at Ravenspur (4th
July) a special messenger was despatched to the city
with the news. The mayor was in bed, but he
hurriedly rose and took steps to proclaim Henry's
arrival in England. "Let us apparel ourselves and go
and receive the Duke of Lancaster, since we agreed to
send for him," was the resolution of those to whom
the mayor conveyed the first tidings; and accordingly
Drew Barentyn, who had succeeded Whitington in
October, 1398, and 500 other citizens, took horse to
meet the duke, whom they escorted to the city. The
day that Henry entered the city was kept as a
holiday, "as though it had been the day for the
celebration of Easter."</p>

misgovernment, and publicly read in the Guildhall.
Four of his advisers and supporters, whose names he
gave up, hoping to gain favour for himself thereby,
were executed at a fishmonger's stall in Cheapside.
Sentence of deposition was passed against him, and
Lancaster proclaimed king in his stead under the title
of King Henry IV.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sentence passed on the late king proved his
death warrant; his haughty spirit broke down, and
he died at Pontefract the following year. According
to Henry's account he died of wilful starvation.
There were many, however, who believed him to
have been put to death by Henry's orders; whilst
others, on the contrary, refused to believe his death
had actually taken place at all, notwithstanding the
fact of the corpse having been purposely exposed to
public view throughout its journey from Pontefract to
London.<a id="noteref_730" name="noteref_730" href="#note_730"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">730</span></span></a> This belief that Richard was still alive was
fostered by many, and, among others, by William
Serle. He had been at one time the late king's
chamberlain, and he kept up the delusion of Richard
being still in the land of the living, by exhibiting
the late king's signet, which had come into his possession.
Serle was eventually arrested in the north
of England and brought to London, to be executed
at Tyburn.<a id="noteref_731" name="noteref_731" href="#note_731"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">731</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sixteen years later (1416), a certain Thomas
Warde, called "Trumpyngtone," personated the late
king, and a scheme was laid for placing him on the
throne with the aid of Sigismund, king of the Romans<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page248">[pg 248]</span><a name="Pg248" id="Pg248" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Sigismund, however, refused to have anything to do
with the plot, which was hatched within the city's
liberties by Benedict Wolman and Thomas Bekering.
The conspiracy having been discovered, its authors
were thrown into prison. One died before trial, the
other paid the penalty for his rashness with his head.<a id="noteref_732" name="noteref_732" href="#note_732"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">732</span></span></a>
In August, 1420, long after Trumpington was dead,
two others, Thomas Cobold and William Bryan,
endeavoured still to keep up the delusion in the city.
The mayor, Whitington, himself ordered their arrest.
Bryan had time to escape from the house of William
Norton, a barber given to Lollardry, where he and
his fellow conspirator were lodged. Cobold tried to
hide himself, but was discovered cunningly concealed
in the house, and taken before the mayor and aldermen.
Being questioned as to the identity of Trumpington
and the late king, he gave an evasive reply,
adding, that the question of identity had become
immaterial since Trumpington had been dead some
time. Cobold was thought to be too dangerous a
man to be allowed at large, so he was committed to
prison.<a id="noteref_733" name="noteref_733" href="#note_733"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">733</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime Wycliffe had died (1384), and
Lollardry had become only another name for general
discontentment. The clergy made strenuous efforts to
suppress the Lollards. Pope Boniface had invoked
the assistance of the late king (1395) to destroy these<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page249">[pg 249]</span><a name="Pg249" id="Pg249" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc147" id="toc147"></a>

city to use their interest with Richard to the same
end.<a id="noteref_734" name="noteref_734" href="#note_734"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">734</span></span></a> Besides seeking the support of the commonalty
against the powerful nobles, the new king sought the
support of the church, and he had not been long on
the throne before he issued commissions for search to
be made in the city for Lollards, and for the arrest of
all preachers found sowing the pestilential seed of
Lollardry (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">semen pestiferum lollardrie</span></span>).<a id="noteref_735" name="noteref_735" href="#note_735"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">735</span></span></a> Early in
1401 a price was put upon the head of the captain
and leader of the sect, Sir John Oldcastle, otherwise
known as Lord Cobham. Public proclamation was
made in the city, that any one giving information
which should lead to his arrest should be rewarded
with 500 marks; any one actually arresting or causing
him to be arrested should receive double that amount,
whilst the citizens and burgesses of any city or
borough who should take and produce him before
the king, should be for ever quit of all taxes, talliages,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Still the clergy were not satisfied. The ecclesiastical
courts could condemn men as heretics, but
they had no power to burn them. Accordingly, a
statute was passed this year (1401), known as the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page250">[pg 250]</span><a name="Pg250" id="Pg250" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
statute of heresy (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">de hæretico comburendo</span></span>), authorising
the ecclesiastical courts to hand over to the civil

being publicly burnt before the people.<a id="noteref_738" name="noteref_738" href="#note_738"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">738</span></span></a> It was the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Henry had other difficulties to face besides
opposition from the nobles. France had refused to

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As time went on, Henry had to try new methods
for raising money. The parliament which met at the
opening of 1404, granted the king a 1<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">s.</span></span> in the
pound on all lands, tenements and rents, besides
20<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">s.</span></span> for every knight's fee. The money so raised
was not, however, to be at the disposal of the
king's own ministers, but was to be placed in the
hands of four officials to be known as treasurers of
war (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Guerrarum Thesaurarii</span></span>). The names of the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page251">[pg 251]</span><a name="Pg251" id="Pg251" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

these were citizens of note. Hadley had already
served as mayor in 1393, Knolles had filled the same
office in 1399, and was re-elected in 1410, whilst
Merlawe was destined to attain that honour both in
1409 and 1417.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was during Merlawe's first mayoralty that

marks,<a id="noteref_743" name="noteref_743" href="#note_743"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">743</span></span></a> to enable him to complete the reduction of

Robert Chichele, the mayor, brother of the archbishop

Richard Whitington and Thomas Knolles, the late

that it was very difficult to discover the true value of
lands and tenements in the city and suburbs, owing to
absence of tenants and dilapidations by fire and

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whitington had already three times occupied the
mayoralty chair; once (in 1396) at the word of a
king, and twice (in 1397 and 1406) at the will of his
fellow citizens. On the occasion of his third election
a solemn mass was for the first time introduced into
the proceedings, the mayor, aldermen and a large<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page253">[pg 253]</span><a name="Pg253" id="Pg253" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc148" id="toc148"></a>

The custom which then sprang up continues in a
modified form to this day, the election of a
mayor being always preceded by divine service. Its
origin may perhaps be ascribed in some measure to
the spirit of Lollardry which, in its best sense, found
much favour with the citizens.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The enormous wealth which he succeeded in amassing
was bestowed in promoting the cause of education,
and in relieving the sufferings of the poor and
afflicted. He built a handsome library in the house of
the Grey Friars and also the Church of Saint Michael
in the "Riole." He is credited by some writers with
having purchased and presented to the corporation
the advowson of the Church of St. Peter upon
Cornhill. But this is probably a mistake arising from
the fact of a license in mortmain having been granted
by Henry IV to Richard Whitington, John Hende,
and others, to convey the manor of Leadenhall,
together with the advowsons of the several churches
of Saint Peter upon Cornhill and Saint Margaret
Patyns, held of the king in free burgage, to the mayor
and commonalty of the City of London and their
successors.<a id="noteref_749" name="noteref_749" href="#note_749"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">749</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the accession of Henry V, Archbishop Arundel,

renewed his attack on the Lollards, and endeavoured
to serve Oldcastle with a citation. Failing to accomplish
this he caused him to be arrested. The bold
defence made by the so-called heretic, when before his
judges, gained additional weight from the reputation
he enjoyed for high moral character. Nevertheless
he was adjudged guilty of the charges brought against
him. A formal sentence of excommunication was
passed, and he was remitted to the Tower for forty
days in the hope that at the expiration of that time
he might be found willing to retract. This, however,
was not to be.</p>

and shortly afterwards appeared at the head of a
number of followers in St. Giles's Fields. Great disappointment
was felt at not receiving the assistance
that had been expected from city servants and
apprentices. According to Walsingham, no less than
5,000 men, comprising masters as well as servants,
from the city, were prepared to join the insurgents,
had not the king taken precautions to secure the
gates. As soon as it was discovered that the
young king had made ample preparations to meet
attack, the Lollards took to flight. Many, however,
failed to make good their escape, and nearly forty
paid the penalty of their rashness with their lives.<a id="noteref_752" name="noteref_752" href="#note_752"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">752</span></span></a><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page255">[pg 255]</span><a name="Pg255" id="Pg255" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Walsingham was probably misinformed as to the
number of the persons who were prepared to assist
the Lollards. The fact is that, to the respectable
City burgess, Lollardism was a matter of less moment
than was the scandalous life led by the chantry priest
and other ministers of religion, and this the civic
authorities were determined to rectify as far as in
them lay. Between the years 1400 and 1440, some
sixty clerks in holy orders were taken in adultery
and clapt into prison by ward beadles.<a id="noteref_753" name="noteref_753" href="#note_753"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">753</span></span></a> Nevertheless
the clergy, and more especially the chantry priest,
continued to live a life of luxury and sloth, oftentimes
spending the day in dicing, card playing, cock fighting
and frequenting taverns.</p>

by name, a currier by trade, was tried in St.
Paul's Church before the new Archbishop and others,
the civic authorities having taken the initiative
according to the provisions of the recent Statute,
and arrested him on suspicion of being a heretic.
The mayor himself was a witness at the trial, and
testified as to the nature of certain books found in
Cleydon's possession; they were "the worst and the
most perverse that ever he did read or see." Walsingham,
who styles Cleydon "an inveterate Lollard"
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quidam inveteratus Lollardus</span></span>), adds, with his usual
acerbity against the entire sect, that the accused
had gone so far as to make his own son a priest, and

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Henry V was resolved to maintain not only the
old religion of the days of Edward III, but also the
old foreign policy, and in 1414 he commenced making
preparations for renewing the claim of his great-grandfather
to the crown of France. In 1415 this claim
was formally made, and Henry gathered his forces
together at Southampton. On the 10th March he
informed the civic authorities of his intention of crossing
over to France to enforce his claim and of his
need of money. On the 14th a brilliant assembly,
comprising the king's two brothers, John, Duke of
Bedford, and Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, Edward,
Duke of York, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the
Bishop of Winchester, and others, met at the Guildhall
to consider the matter.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A question arose as to order of precedence, and it
was arranged that the mayor, as the king's representative
in the City, should occupy the centre seat, having
the Primate and the Bishop of Winchester on his<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page258">[pg 258]</span><a name="Pg258" id="Pg258" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

meeting, we presume, got to business; but what took
place is not recorded in the City's archives. We
know, however, that in June the king pledged his

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 15th June the king, who was then on his

laid siege. It offered, however, a stubborn defence,
and it was not until the 18th September that the
town surrendered. On the 22nd Henry sent a long
account of the siege and capture to the mayor and
citizens of London, bidding them render humble
thanks to Almighty God for this mercy, and expressing
a hope of further success in the near future.<a id="noteref_769" name="noteref_769" href="#note_769"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">769</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The battle of Agincourt was fought on the 25th
October, and news of the joyous victory arrived in
England on or before the 28th, on which day—the
Feast of St. Simon and St. Jude—Nicholas Wotton,
the recently elected mayor, was sworn into office at
the Guildhall according to custom. On the following
day, therefore, the mayor, aldermen and a large
number of the commonalty made a solemn pilgrimage
on foot to Westminster, where they first made devout
thanksgiving for the victory that had been won, and
then proceeded to present the new mayor before the
Barons of the Exchequer. Care is taken in the City<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page260">[pg 260]</span><a name="Pg260" id="Pg260" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
records to explain that the procession went on this
occasion on foot, simply and solely for the purpose of
marking their humble thanks to the Almighty and his
Saints, and more especially to Edward the Confessor,
who lay interred at Westminster, for the joyful news
which so unexpectedly had arrived. The journey on
foot was not to be drawn into precedent when others
succeeded to the mayoralty, nor supplant the riding
in state which had been customary on such occasions.<a id="noteref_771" name="noteref_771" href="#note_771"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">771</span></span></a>
The reception given to the king by the Londoners on
his return from France, was of so brilliant and varied
a character, that one chronicler declares that a description
of it would require a special treatise.<a id="noteref_772" name="noteref_772" href="#note_772"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">772</span></span></a> On the
16th November he landed at Dover and proceeded
towards London. On Saturday, the 23rd, the mayor
and aldermen and all the companies rode forth in
their liveries to meet the king and conduct him and
his train of French prisoners through the City to
Westminster. On Sunday morning a deputation from
the City waited upon Henry and presented him with
the sum of £1,000 and two basons of gold worth half
that sum.<a id="noteref_773" name="noteref_773" href="#note_773"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">773</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During the next eighteen months succeeding the
battle of Agincourt, Henry devoted himself to
making preparations at home for renewing active
military operations. He had intended at midsummer,
1416, to lead an expedition in person to the relief
of Harfleur, but the command was subsequently<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page261">[pg 261]</span><a name="Pg261" id="Pg261" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc151" id="toc151"></a>
delegated to his brother, the Duke of Bedford. Proclamation
was publicly made in the city by order of the
king, dated the 28th May, that all and singular
knights, esquires and valets holding any fief or
annuity from the king should proceed to Southampton
by the 20th June, armed each according to his estate,
for the purpose of joining the expedition.<a id="noteref_774" name="noteref_774" href="#note_774"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">774</span></span></a> In 1417
France was rendered weak by factions, and Henry
seized the opportunity for another attack. On the 1st
February he issued his writ to the sheriffs of London
for a return to be made of the number of men-at-arms
and archers the City knights could furnish.<a id="noteref_775" name="noteref_775" href="#note_775"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">775</span></span></a> In

further sum was advanced by private subscription
among the wealthier citizens on the security of a
Spanish sword, set in gold and precious stones, of the
estimated value of £2,000. The sword was pledged
with the subscribers on the understanding that they
would not dispose of it before Michaelmas twelve-month.<a id="noteref_778" name="noteref_778" href="#note_778"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">778</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 9th August the king addressed a letter to

Normandy and of his success in making himself

To this the citizens sent a dutiful reply on the
28th day of the same month, assuring the king of the
peaceful condition of the city. On the 2nd September
an order went forth from the Common Council of
the City that each alderman should immediately
instruct the constables of his ward to go their rounds
and warn all soldiers they might come across, to
vacate the City and set out on the king's service
before the end of the week on pain of imprisonment.<a id="noteref_780" name="noteref_780" href="#note_780"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">780</span></span></a>
Success continued to attend Henry's arms. On the
5th September he was able to inform the citizens, by
letter,<a id="noteref_781" name="noteref_781" href="#note_781"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">781</span></span></a> of the capture of Caen, excepting only the
citadel, and this was to be rendered to him by
the 19th day of the same month at the latest, unless
relief should have previously arrived for the besieged
from the King of France, his son the Dauphin, or the
Count of Armagnac, Constable of France. The Duke
of Clarence wrote a few days later to the citizens,
notifying the extraordinary success which had followed
the king. So many towns and fortresses had been
taken that the only fear was that there were not
sufficient men to keep guard over them.<a id="noteref_782" name="noteref_782" href="#note_782"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">782</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In order to keep the English force in Normandy
better provided with victuals, the Duke of Bedford,
who had been left behind as the king's lieutenant,
caused the Sheriffs of London to proclaim that all
persons willing and able to ship victuals to France for<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page263">[pg 263]</span><a name="Pg263" id="Pg263" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc152" id="toc152"></a>

in the parliament, which met in
November, 1417. On the 17th December this parliament
granted the king two fifteenths and two tenths.
No time was lost in taking measures for collecting
these supplies, the king's writ appointing commissioners
for the City of London being issued the day
following.<a id="noteref_785" name="noteref_785" href="#note_785"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">785</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Paris matters were going on from bad to
worse. Whilst the capital of France was at the
mercy of a mob, Henry proceeded to lay close siege
to Rouen. Frequent proclamation was made in
London for reinforcements to join the king, either at
Rouen or elsewhere in Normandy.<a id="noteref_786" name="noteref_786" href="#note_786"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">786</span></span></a> This was in
April, 1418, or thereabouts. On the 5th July, the
Duke of Clarence informed Richard Merlawe, the
mayor, by letter, of the fall of Louviers, and of the
expected surrender of Pont de l'Arche,<a id="noteref_787" name="noteref_787" href="#note_787"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">787</span></span></a> from which
latter place the duke wrote. On the 10th August
Henry himself wrote to the citizens informing them
of his having sat down before Rouen and of the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page264">[pg 264]</span><a name="Pg264" id="Pg264" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
straits his forces were in for lack of victuals and
more especially of "drink." He begged them to
send as many small vessels as they could, laden
with provisions, to Harfleur, whence they could
make their way up the Seine to Rouen.<a id="noteref_788" name="noteref_788" href="#note_788"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">788</span></span></a> In less
than a month a reply was sent (8 Sept.) from
Gravesend under the seal of the mayoralty, informing
Henry that the citizens had been busy brewing ale
and beer and purveying wine and other "vitaille," and
that they had despatched thirty butts of sweet wine—comprising
ten of "Tyre," ten of "Romesey," and ten
of "Malvesy"—and 1,000 pipes of ale and beer.
With these they had also sent 25,000 cups for the
king's "host" to drink out of.<a id="noteref_789" name="noteref_789" href="#note_789"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">789</span></span></a> In the meantime, the
besieged received no such relief from the pains of
hunger and thirst, and on the 19th January, 1419,
they were compelled to surrender their ancient town.<a id="noteref_790" name="noteref_790" href="#note_790"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">790</span></span></a>
The war continued throughout the year (1419),
all attempts at a reconciliation proving abortive.
Pointoise fell into Henry's hands; and both Henry
and the Duke of Clarence sent word of its capture to
London. The duke took the opportunity of asking
that the freedom of the City might be conferred on
his servant, Roger Tillyngton, a skinner; but the
citizens in acknowledging the duke's letter make no
reference to his request.<a id="noteref_791" name="noteref_791" href="#note_791"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">791</span></span></a></p>

and the French king, finding further resistance hopeless,
was content to make peace. By the treaty of

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 26th January, 1421, the Duke of Gloucester,
the Guardian of England in the king's absence,
ordered the Sheriffs of London to announce that the
queen's coronation would take place at Westminster
on the third Sunday in Lent.<a id="noteref_797" name="noteref_797" href="#note_797"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">797</span></span></a> The king and queen
landed at Dover with a small retinue on the 1st February,
and after a few days' rest at Canterbury,
entered the city of London amid tokens of welcome
and respect from the laity and clergy. They took up
their abode at the Tower, whence they were conducted
on the day appointed for the coronation to
Westminster by the citizens on foot and on horseback.<a id="noteref_798" name="noteref_798" href="#note_798"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">798</span></span></a></p>

that he entertained of reforming and governing his

headed, sooner or later, a crusade which should have
stayed the progress of the Ottoman and have recovered

Paris, on the last day of August, 1422, leaving a child<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page267">[pg 267]</span><a name="Pg267" id="Pg267" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc154" id="toc154"></a>
nine months old—the unhappy Henry of Windsor
who succeeded to the throne as Henry VI. When
the body of the late king was brought over from
France to be buried at Westminster, the citizens
showed it every token of respect in its passage through
London. The streets of the city, as well as of the
borough of Southwark, were cleaned for the occasion.
The mayor, sheriffs, recorder and aldermen, accompanied
by the chief burgesses, and clad in white gowns
and hoods, went forth to meet the remains of the
king they loved so well, as far as St. George's bar
in Southwark, and reverently conducted them to St.
Paul's Church, where the funeral obsequies were performed.
The next day they accompanied the corpse
to Westminster, where further ceremonies took place.
Representatives of the various wards were told off to
line the streets, the solemnity of the occasion being
marked by the burning of torches, whilst chaplains
stood in the porches of the various churches, clad in
their richest copes, with thuribles in their hands, and
chanted the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">venite</span></span> and incensed the royal remains as
they passed. The livery companies provided amongst
them 211 torches, and to each torch-bearer the city
chamberlain gave a gown and hood of white material
or "blanket" (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">de blanqueto</span></span>), at the "cost of the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At the death of Henry V the administration of
affairs fell into the hands of his two brothers, John,
Duke of Bedford, and Humfrey, Duke of Gloucester.
On the 29th September a writ was issued from
Windsor, in the name of the infant on whom the
crown of England had devolved, summoning four
citizens of London to attend a parliament to be held
at Westminster at Martinmas,<a id="noteref_801" name="noteref_801" href="#note_801"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">801</span></span></a> and two days afterwards
another was addressed to the sheriffs of London,
enjoining them to make proclamation for the keeping
the king's peace, and authorising them to arrest and
imprison rioters until the king and his council should
determine upon their punishment.<a id="noteref_802" name="noteref_802" href="#note_802"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">802</span></span></a> The precise wishes
of the late king as to the respective parts which Bedford
and Gloucester were to undertake in the government
of the realm are not clearly known, but it is
generally thought that he intended the former to
govern France, whilst the latter was to act as his
vicegerent in England. An attempt to carry out the
arrangement was doomed to failure.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As soon as parliament met (9 Nov.) it took
into consideration the respective claims of the two
dukes. Bedford had already (26 Oct.) despatched
a letter from Rouen, addressed to the civic authorities,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page269">[pg 269]</span><a name="Pg269" id="Pg269" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc157" id="toc157"></a>
setting forth his right to the government of the
realm, as elder brother of the deceased sovereign
and as the party most interested in the succession
to the crown. Without mentioning Gloucester by
name, he warned the citizens against executing orders
derogatory to himself. He professed to do this, not
from any ambitious designs of his own, but from a
wish to preserve intact the laws, usage and customs
of the realm.<a id="noteref_803" name="noteref_803" href="#note_803"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">803</span></span></a> After some hesitation, parliament
resolved to appoint Bedford protector as soon as he
should return from France, but that during his absence
Gloucester should act for him.<a id="noteref_804" name="noteref_804" href="#note_804"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">804</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 8th February of the new year (1423),
the sheriffs of London received orders to make proclamation
for all soldiers who were in the king's pay
to assemble at Winchelsea by the 1st day of March,
as an expedition was to set sail from that port for
the purpose of defending the town and castle of
Crotoye. The business was pressing and necessitated a
repetition of the order to the sheriffs a fortnight later
(22 Feb.).<a id="noteref_805" name="noteref_805" href="#note_805"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">805</span></span></a></p>

mayor, William Sevenoke, William Waldene, and

into cases of treason and felony within the city; and
two days later they found Sir John Mortimer, who
was charged with a treasonable design in favour of
the Earl of March, guilty of having broken prison.<a id="noteref_806" name="noteref_806" href="#note_806"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">806</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 5th June (1423) the hearts of the citizens
were gladdened with the news that they were likely
to be repaid some of the money they had advanced
to the king's grandfather. Orders were given for all
persons to whom Henry IV was indebted at the time
of his decease, and who had not yet received from
his executors a moiety of the sums due, to send in
their bills and tallies to Sir John Pelham and John
Leventhorp, two of the king's executors, sitting at
the Priory of Saint Mary, Southwark, by the Monday
next after Midsummer-day.<a id="noteref_807" name="noteref_807" href="#note_807"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">807</span></span></a> We can believe that

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At home as well as abroad Gloucester soon made
enemies; among them was his own uncle, the Chancellor,
Henry Beaufort, Bishop of Winchester, a
wealthy and ambitious prelate. During Gloucester's
absence on the continent, whither he had gone to
recover the estates of his newly-married wife, the
ill-fated Jacqueline of Hainault, Beaufort garrisoned
the Tower with creatures of his own. When Gloucester
returned mutual recriminations took place, and
the mayor was ordered (29 Oct., 1425) to prevent
Beaufort entering the city. A riot ensued in which
the citizens took the part of the duke, and the bishop
had to take refuge in Southwark. The quarrel was
patched up for awhile until Bedford, who was sent
for, should arrive to act as arbitrator.<a id="noteref_808" name="noteref_808" href="#note_808"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">808</span></span></a> He arrived in
London on the 10th January, 1426. The citizens,
who had more than once been in communication with<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page271">[pg 271]</span><a name="Pg271" id="Pg271" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the duke<a id="noteref_809" name="noteref_809" href="#note_809"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">809</span></span></a> during his absence abroad, presented him
with a pair of basins, silver-gilt, containing 1,000
marks. The gift, however, does not appear to have
been so graciously received as it might have been,
for a London alderman records that the donors, for
all their liberality, "hadde but lytylle thanke."<a id="noteref_810" name="noteref_810" href="#note_810"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">810</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The two brothers had not met since the death of
Henry V. After prolonged negotiations, a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">modus
vivendi</span></span> between the parties was arrived at, and
Gloucester and the bishop were induced to shake
hands. Beaufort left England soon afterwards with
the Duke of Bedford, on the plea of making a pilgrimage,
and did not return until September, 1428,
by which time he had been made a cardinal and
appointed papal legate in England. Notwithstanding
his legatine authority being unacknowledged by
Gloucester and others, the citizens received him on
his return "worthily and loyally," riding out to
meet him and escorting him into London.<a id="noteref_811" name="noteref_811" href="#note_811"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">811</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Gloucester had always been a favourite with the
Londoners, until his conduct to his Flemish wife,
whom he left behind on the continent to fight her
own battles as best as she could, and the undisguised
attention he paid to Eleanor Cobham, a lady in his
wife's suite, whom he eventually married, estranged
their favour. In August, 1424, the Common Council
had voted the duke a gift of 500 marks; and two
years later—viz., in April, 1426—the citizens raised a
sum, variously stated to have been £1,000 and 1,000
marks, for the benefit of his duchess.<a id="noteref_812" name="noteref_812" href="#note_812"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">812</span></span></a> The female<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page272">[pg 272]</span><a name="Pg272" id="Pg272" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
portion of the community were specially incensed
against the duke, and a number of women went the
length of presenting themselves before parliament in
1427, with a letter complaining of his behaviour towards
his wife. In March of the next year (1428)
the citizens themselves followed suit, and drew the
attention of parliament, through the mouth of John
Symond, their Recorder, to the wretched straits to
which the duchess had been reduced, as witnessed her
own letters. They begged parliament to consider the
best means for recovering for her the lands of Hainault,
Holland and Zeeland, which had always been
places of sure refuge for the English merchant, and
the rulers of which had ever been friendly to the king
of England. The citizens finally avowed themselves
ready to take upon themselves their share in any
undertaking the lords and commons of the realm might
decide upon.<a id="noteref_813" name="noteref_813" href="#note_813"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">813</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime matters had not gone well with
the English in France. In July, 1427, the Earl of
Salisbury came over to London for reinforcements.<a id="noteref_814" name="noteref_814" href="#note_814"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">814</span></span></a>
In September of the following year he was able to

of Orleans, before which town he shortly afterwards
met his death. Bedford continued the siege, but the
town held out until May, 1429, when it was relieved
by the Maid from the little village of Domremi, and
the English army was compelled to retreat.</p>

relieve the town, the citizens of London were suffering
from a severe dearth. At length the Common
Council resolved (22 July, 1429) to send agents
abroad for the purpose of transmitting all the corn
they could lay their hands on to England. The
assistance of Bedford, who had by this time been
compelled to raise the siege of Orleans, was invoked.<a id="noteref_816" name="noteref_816" href="#note_816"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">816</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Bedford had recently been joined by Beaufort,
who had become more than ever an object of hatred
to Gloucester, and had lost to a certain extent the
goodwill of the nation by the acceptance of a
cardinal's hat. He had set out on the 22nd June
(1429), carrying with him a small force which he was
allowed to raise for the avowed object of prosecuting
a Hussite crusade in Bohemia, but which was
eventually sent to France.<a id="noteref_817" name="noteref_817" href="#note_817"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">817</span></span></a> The question of his

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Members of parliament representing the City of
London had hitherto been allowed a certain amount
of cloth and fur trimming at the City's expense,
wherewith to dress themselves and their personal
attendants in a manner suitable to the position they
held. Those who had from time to time been elected
members appear to have abused this privilege—where
a yard had been given, they had literally taken
an ell—and it was now thought to be high time to
take steps to check the abuse in future. Accordingly
it was ordained by the mayor and aldermen, on the
12th August of this year (and the ordinance met with<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page274">[pg 274]</span><a name="Pg274" id="Pg274" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the approval of the commoners on the 29th day of

elected to attend parliament should take out of the
chamber or of the commonalty more than ten yards
for gown and cloak, at 15<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">s.</span></span> the yard, and 100<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">s.</span></span>
for fur if the alderman had already served as

moreover, was to be allowed eight yards of cloth
at 28 pence a yard for two personal attendants,
and each commoner four yards of the same for one
attendant, if the parliament was sitting in London or
the neighbourhood, and eight yards for two attendants
if parliament was sitting in some more remote place,

coronation of the young king, whose right to the
French crown had been established by the Treaty of
Troyes. At his accession to the throne of England
Henry VI was but a child of nine months. He was
now eight years old. Before he could be crowned
King of France, it was necessary that he should first
be crowned King of England. Proclamation was

rectors and curates of the city, in the richest copes,
and 500 secular chaplains in the whitest of surplices,
with whom were a like number of monks bearing
crosses, tapers and incense, and chanting psalms
and antiphons in grateful thanks for his safe return.
Thence the royal cavalcade passed through Southwark
to the city, where pageants appeared at every
turn. The fulsome adulation bestowed upon a lad
scarcely ten years of age was enough to turn his
young brain. Passing through Cornhill and Chepe, the
procession eventually reached St. Paul's. There the
king dismounted, and being met by the Archbishop
of Canterbury and ten other bishops in their pontifical
robes, was led by them to the high altar. Prayers
were said and the sacred relics kissed. The king
then remounted his horse and made his way to his
palace of Westminster, the streets being hung with
tapestry and the houses thronged to their roofs with
crowds of onlookers, and was there allowed a brief
day's rest. On the following Saturday a deputation<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page277">[pg 277]</span><a name="Pg277" id="Pg277" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc160" id="toc160"></a>
from the city, headed by the mayor and aldermen,
went to the palace and presented Henry with £1,000
of the purest gold, in a gold casket, with these
words:—</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Beaufort, who had returned home in time for
the coronation, had again set out for France with
the king, and Gloucester took advantage of their
absence to renew his attack on his rival. Letters of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">prœmunire</span></span> were drawn up in anticipation of the cardinal's
return, and additional offence was given by the
seizure of the cardinal's plate and jewels at Dover.
On learning of Gloucester's schemes, Beaufort determined
to give up a projected visit to Rome, and to
return home in time for the opening of parliament
(12th May, 1432).<a id="noteref_826" name="noteref_826" href="#note_826"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">826</span></span></a> He desired to learn why he had
been thus "strangely demeened" contrary to his
deserts. When parliament met and the cardinal
asked who were his accusers, Gloucester held his<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page278">[pg 278]</span><a name="Pg278" id="Pg278" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
tongue, and the king expressed his confidence in the
cardinal's loyalty. In the following year (1433)
Bedford appeared before parliament and announced
that he had come home to defend himself against
false accusations. He understood that the recent
losses that had occurred in France were attributed to
his neglect. He desired his accusers, of whom he
shrewdly suspected Gloucester to be one, to stand
forth and prove their charges. Again there was
silence, and the duke, like the cardinal, had to rest
satisfied with the king's assurance of loyalty.<a id="noteref_827" name="noteref_827" href="#note_827"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">827</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The finances of the country were at this time
(1433) in the most deplorable condition. It was
necessary to exercise the strictest economy. Bedford
was the first to set an example of self-denial
by offering to discharge the duties of counsellor at a
reduced salary. Gloucester followed his brother's
example. The archbishops, the cardinal, and the
bishops of Lincoln and Ely agreed to render their
services without payment. Parliament showed its
good will by voting a fifteenth and tenth, but out of
the sum thus realised £4,000 was to be applied to
the relief of poor towns. The amount of relief
which fell to the share of the poorer wards of the
City of London was £76 15<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">s.</span></span> 6-1/4<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d.</span></span>, which was

and undertake the office of chief counsellor, but
differences again arising between him and Gloucester,
which the personal interference of the young king
could with difficulty calm, he again set sail for France
(June, 1434). His career was fast drawing to an end.
Burgundy was intending to desert him as he knew
full well, and the knowledge accelerated his end.
His death took place at Rouen on the 14th September
of the following year (1435).<a id="noteref_830" name="noteref_830" href="#note_830"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">830</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With his death England's supremacy in France
began to decline, and Henry VI was to lose in that
country all or nearly all that had been gained by his
doughty predecessor. The defection of Burgundy
was followed by the loss of Paris. The chief event
of 1436 was the raising of the siege of Calais, which
had been invested by the Duke of Burgundy. On
the 27th June the mayor and aldermen of Calais,
being anxious to get help from the government at
home, and finding that according to precedent they
could only do so through the mediation of the City of
London, addressed a letter to the mayor and aldermen
of London imploring them, as the head of "the
principal of all the cities of the realm of England," to
move the king to send the requisite aid.<a id="noteref_831" name="noteref_831" href="#note_831"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">831</span></span></a></p>

The king, too, had been very urgent that the City
should raise a force to oppose "the man who stiled
himself Duke of Burgundy and Count of Flanders,"
whilst he took pains to conciliate such Flemings as
were living in the city and were ready to take an oath

peace, but it failed, and a new tax—a tax upon aliens—had
to be imposed for the purpose of raising money

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The streets of the city have witnessed few sadder
sights than the penance inflicted on Eleanor
Cobham, at one time the mistress, and afterwards—on
the dissolution of his marriage with Jacqueline—the
wife of Gloucester. The new duchess was aware
that in the event of the king's death her husband was
next in succession to the throne, and was inclined to
anticipate matters. It was a superstitious age, and
the duchess invoked the aid of witchcraft to accomplish
her wishes. In 1441 her operations, innocent as<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page281">[pg 281]</span><a name="Pg281" id="Pg281" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc162" id="toc162"></a>
they were in themselves, however bad their intent,
were discovered, and she was condemned to do public
penance followed by imprisonment for life. For three
days the wretched lady was made to walk the streets,
taper in hand and bare-foot (it was November), in the
sight of all the citizens, who were forbidden to show
her any respect, but, at the same time, were ordered
not to molest her.<a id="noteref_836" name="noteref_836" href="#note_836"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">836</span></span></a> The latter they were little likely
to do. Nay! on each day as she landed at the

and sheriffs went forth to attend her, accompanied by
members of the livery companies.<a id="noteref_837" name="noteref_837" href="#note_837"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">837</span></span></a> Yet, not a finger

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The king was now under the influence of William
de la Pole, Earl of Suffolk, by whose intervention a
truce with France had been concluded on the 28th
May of this year (1444), to last until the 1st April,
1446. In order to strengthen the truce, a marriage<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page282">[pg 282]</span><a name="Pg282" id="Pg282" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was arranged between Henry and Margaret of Anjou.
The princess came over to England early in the following
year, and was married on the 22nd April (1445).
The match was not altogether a popular one; nevertheless,
when Margaret passed through the city on
her way to be crowned at Westminster, she was received
"in the most goodly wise, with alle the
citezines on horseback ridyng ayenst hir to the
Blackheth in blew gownes and rede hodes."<a id="noteref_840" name="noteref_840" href="#note_840"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">840</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The truce was renewed, and Suffolk increased in
popularity. After the deaths of Gloucester and
Cardinal Beaufort, within a few weeks of each other,
in 1447, he became the king's chief adviser, and continued
to be so until the loss of the French provinces
three years later (1450) raised so much opposition
against him that the king was compelled to order his
banishment. This was not thought a sufficient
punishment by his enemies, and he was taken on the
high seas and brutally murdered (2 May). After his
death an attack was made on his supporters. Again
the men of Kent rose in revolt; this time under the
leadership of an Irish adventurer—Jack Cade—who
called himself Mortimer, and gave out that he was an
illegitimate son of the late Earl of March. They
mustered on Blackheath 30,000 strong (1 June), and
then awaited the king's return from Leicester, where
parliament had been sitting. Henry on his arrival
sent to learn the reason of the gathering, and in
reply received a long list of grievances which the
rebels intended to amend.<a id="noteref_841" name="noteref_841" href="#note_841"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">841</span></span></a>  Notwithstanding the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page283">[pg 283]</span><a name="Pg283" id="Pg283" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
boldness of this answer, the king had only to make
proclamation that all his true and liege subjects should
"a-voyde the fylde," for the whole force to disperse
in the course of one night. The danger, indeed,
seemed to be over. A week later, however, the
royal force met a number of the rebels near Sevenoaks,
by whom it was put to rout. Encouraged by this
success, the rebels returned and took up their
quarters in Southwark. The unhappy king had by
this time retired to Kenilworth, notwithstanding the
offer made by the citizens of London to stand by him.<a id="noteref_842" name="noteref_842" href="#note_842"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">842</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The city authorities had, in the meantime, taken
steps to put the city into a state of defence. A Common
Council met on the 8th June, when it decided
that an efficient guard should be placed night and day
upon all gates, wharves and lanes leading to the
Thames. An enclosure recently erected at "le Crane"
on the riverside belonging to John Trevillian, was
ordered to be abated. Balistic machines (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">fundibula</span></span>)
of all kinds were to be collected on the wharves,
whilst the sale of weapons or armour or their
removal out of the city was restricted. Lastly, it
was agreed to represent to the king the advisability
of limiting the number of his nobles coming into the
city, owing to the scarcity of provisions.<a id="noteref_843" name="noteref_843" href="#note_843"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">843</span></span></a> On the
26th June the Common Council again met, and it
was then decided to send two mounted men to reconnoitre
Cade's position, and to learn, if possible, his<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page284">[pg 284]</span><a name="Pg284" id="Pg284" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
movements.<a id="noteref_844" name="noteref_844" href="#note_844"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">844</span></span></a> Three days later (29 June) orders were
given for four men to be selected from each ward to
assist the aldermen in preserving the peace. Anyone
refusing to do his duty in keeping watch was to be
sent to prison. In spite of all precautions, Cade and
his followers succeeded in gaining a footing in the city
(3 July), their first action being to sack the house of
Philip Malpas.<a id="noteref_845" name="noteref_845" href="#note_845"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">845</span></span></a> Cade himself encouraged rather
than restrained the excesses of his men. "Now is
Mortimer lord of the City," he cried as he struck with
his sword the old Roman mile-stone known as
London stone.<a id="noteref_846" name="noteref_846" href="#note_846"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">846</span></span></a> It is clear that the rebels had friends
in the city, otherwise they would never have effected
an entrance so easily—"They had othyr men with
hem as welle of London as of there owne party."<a id="noteref_847" name="noteref_847" href="#note_847"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">847</span></span></a>
The matter was made the subject of investigation by
the Common Council. Evidence was given by
Thomas Geffrey, a barber, to the effect that on
Friday, the 3rd July, the keys of the bridge had been
given up, but by whom he knew not. William
Reynold also deposed that Richard Philip, a grocer,
had told him that unless the wardens of the bridge
opened the gates, the Kentish captain threatened to
set fire to the bridge and the city, and that thereupon
Thomas Godfrey, a "sporyour," clad in russet,
brought the keys and opened the gates.<a id="noteref_848" name="noteref_848" href="#note_848"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">848</span></span></a></p>

Robert Horne, alderman of Bridge Ward, who had
rendered himself especially obnoxious to the rebels,
was made prisoner and sent to Newgate. Sir James
Fiennes, the Lord Say, was brought from the Tower
to the Guildhall, where the rebels were holding mock
trials on those who were unfortunate enough to fall
into their hands, and, after a hasty examination, was
conveyed to the Standard in Chepe and there executed.
His head, together with those of two others who had
that day suffered a similar fate, was set up on London
Bridge.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By the next evening (Sunday) the citizens had
managed to recover their presence of mind, and
sallied out at ten o'clock at night, under the leadership
of Lord Scales and another, across the bridge.
Before they had arrived on the Southwark side of the
river they were met by the rebels, and a severe fight
took place between the parties on the bridge itself,
lasting until eight o'clock the next morning. At last
the rebels were defeated, and the city freed from their
presence. Offers of pardon were made and accepted,
and the rebels dispersed. Cade, however, continued
to plunder and ravage the country, until a price having
been put upon his head, he was apprehended by the
Sheriff of Kent,<a id="noteref_849" name="noteref_849" href="#note_849"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">849</span></span></a> and died the same night from injuries
received at his capture. His head was subsequently
set up on London Bridge.</p>

as to the right of succession to the throne, and gave
rise to much rivalry and mutual mistrust between
Richard, Duke of York, who now for the first time
becomes a conspicuous figure on the stage, and
Edmund Beaufort, recently created Duke of Somerset.
Both of them could claim to be the king's nearest kinsmen,
both of them being descendants of Edward III,
the one tracing his descent, on his father's side,
through Edmund Langley, and on his mother's side,
through Lionel, Duke of Clarence, whilst the other
was the surviving representative of John of Gaunt.</p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">Rivalry between the Dukes of York and Somerset, 1450.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The king's incapacity to govern without a strong
minister at his back, as evinced by his conduct
during the recent outbreak, induced both of these
nobles to throw up their appointments, the one in
Ireland and the other in France, and to hasten home.
The Duke of York was the first to reach England,
and, in spite of measures which had been taken to
intercept him, made his way to London. He was
anxious in the first place to clear himself of suspicion
of having been implicated in Cade's rebellion,<a id="noteref_850" name="noteref_850" href="#note_850"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">850</span></span></a> and to
this end sought and obtained an interview with the
king. Having satisfied Henry on this point, he next
proceeded to demand the reform of certain abuses in
the government. A short session of parliament, which
met on the 6th November, opened with an altercation
between the rival dukes. On the 1st December
Somerset was placed under arrest; and on the following
day his lodgings at the Black Friars were broken
into and pillaged. An example was made of one of<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page287">[pg 287]</span><a name="Pg287" id="Pg287" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc164" id="toc164"></a>
the men convicted of being concerned in the breaking
into the Black Friars, and he was beheaded at the
Standard in Chepe. The Duke of York made a personal
visit to the city, and caused proclamation to
be made of the heavy pains and penalties which
should follow any attempt at robbery. As a further
demonstration against lawlessness, the king himself
rode through the city a few days later, accompanied
by his lords in full panoply, the route being kept by
a line of armed citizens on either side of the way.
Alderman Gregory, whose chronicle affords us a vivid
picture of contemporary events, and who was called
upon to serve the office of mayor of the city the
following year, confesses that the procession on this
occasion would have been a gay and glorious sight,
"if hit hadde ben in Fraunce, but not in Ingelonde,"
for it boded little good.<a id="noteref_851" name="noteref_851" href="#note_851"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">851</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Duke of Somerset did not long remain in
prison, for immediately after Christmas he was appointed
captain of Calais. In 1451 the disasters
which followed the English arms in France, when
Calais was again threatened, were made an occasion
for another attempt by York to crush his rival. He
openly avowed his determination to proceed against
Somerset, and, joined by the Earl of Devonshire
and Lord Cobham, marched to London (Jan., 1452).
Henry at once prepared to march against his cousin.
The duke had hoped that through the influence of his
party within the city, the gates would have been
flung open on his approach. In this he was disappointed.
The majority of the citizens were still
loyal to Henry, and by his orders entrance was denied<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page288">[pg 288]</span><a name="Pg288" id="Pg288" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the duke, who thereupon withdrew to Dartford, whilst
the king's forces encamped at Blackheath.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For a time civil war was avoided, the king
promising that Somerset should be again committed
to custody until he should answer such charges as York
should bring against him. The king, however, failed
to keep his word. Somerset was allowed to remain
in power, and York was only allowed his liberty after
he had consented to swear public allegiance to the
king in St. Paul's Church. Any stronger measures
taken against him would probably have provoked
disturbance in the city.<a id="noteref_852" name="noteref_852" href="#note_852"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">852</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Henry's mind had never been strong, and in the
following year (1453) it entirely gave way. In
October the queen bore him a son, after eight years
of married life, but though the infant was brought to
his father, Henry gave no signs of recognising his
presence. The illness of the king, and the birth of an
heir to the crown, were events which materially
affected the fortunes of the Duke of York. In November
the civic authorities prepared for emergencies;
every citizen was to provide himself with armour, but
he was strictly enjoined to be guarded in his conversation,
and not to provoke tumult by showing favour
to this or that lord. Even a proposal that the mayor
and aldermen should pay a visit of respect to the
Duke of York was rejected as impolitic at the present
juncture.<a id="noteref_853" name="noteref_853" href="#note_853"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">853</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Notwithstanding liberal grants made by parliament
for the defence of Calais, that town was still in
danger. On the 29th November, 1453, a letter was
read before the Common Council of the City, emanating
from the Lord Welles and the Lord Ryvers,
asking for assistance towards putting Calais into a
state of defence. Further consideration of the matter
was adjourned until the following 4th December. By
the 7th day of the same month the Council had consulted
the commons, who had declared that owing to
their numerous burdens and expenses they could contribute
nothing to that end.<a id="noteref_854" name="noteref_854" href="#note_854"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">854</span></span></a> This did not prevent a

and again they pleaded the excessive burdens they
were already called upon to bear, and the losses they
had sustained by seizure of their ships and merchandise
by the Duke of Burgundy, rendering them unable for
the present to undertake any further charges unless
steps were taken for the recovery of their goods.<a id="noteref_856" name="noteref_856" href="#note_856"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">856</span></span></a> An
answer to this effect was accordingly delivered by the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The plea of poverty was no idle one, if we may

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A crisis, in the meanwhile, was fast approaching.
The birth of an heir to the throne urged the Duke of
York to take prompt action. Although the majority
of the nobles were opposed to him, he had on his side
the powerful family of the Nevills, having married
Cicely Nevill, sister of Richard Nevill, Earl of Salisbury,
the head of the family, and father of the still
more powerful Earl of Warwick. Towards the end of
January (1454) the Duke of York, the Earls of Salisbury
and Warwick, and others of the duke's supporters,
entered the city, each followed by a large force of retainers
fully armed. With them came also York's eldest
son, the Earl of March, afterwards King Edward IV.<a id="noteref_861" name="noteref_861" href="#note_861"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">861</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Common Council were anxious lest the presence
of these nobles in the city should lead to a disturbance.
A strict neutrality was ordered to be observed
both by the mayor and aldermen, as well as by
the inhabitants of the city at large. The <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">waytes</span></span>, or
watchmen, were ordered to perambulate the streets
every night with their minstrels to keep the citizens in
good humour (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pro recreacione hominum</span></span>), and prevent
robbery. Nevertheless, there is evidence to show
that disturbances did occasionally arise between the
inhabitants and those in the suite of the nobles.<a id="noteref_862" name="noteref_862" href="#note_862"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">862</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The king's continued illness necessitated sooner
or later the appointment of a regent. For a brief
space there seemed a possibility of the regency being
claimed by the queen. The City, in the meanwhile,
paid court to both parties, the mayor and aldermen
one day paying a solemn visit to the queen, attired in
their gowns of scarlet, and a few days later paying a
similar compliment to the Duke of York.<a id="noteref_863" name="noteref_863" href="#note_863"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">863</span></span></a> At length
the duke was nominated protector (3 April). Some

what subject we know not,<a id="noteref_864" name="noteref_864" href="#note_864"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">864</span></span></a> but on the 13th May

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So long as the king remained an imbecile York
was supreme, his rival, Somerset, having been committed
to prison at his instigation in December, 1453.
Henry, however, soon recovered from his illness,
although his convalescence proved of equally short
duration, and York's protectorate came to an end.
With Henry's restoration came the release of Somerset,
and York determined to try conclusions with his
rival in the field. At the first battle of St. Albans,
fought on the 22nd May, 1455, victory declared for
York and Somerset was killed. After the battle
York accompanied the king to London and lodged
him in the bishop's palace in St. Paul's churchyard.
The excitement caused Henry a relapse, and York was
for the second time named protector; but in the
spring of 1456 he had again to retire upon the king's
recovery.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Just when the country was settling down to enjoy
a period of comparative quiet, there occurred (May,
1456) in the city one of those sudden outbreaks
against the "merchant stranger" residing within the
city's walls which too often appear in the annals of
London. On this occasion the young mercers of the
city rose against the Lombards; why or wherefore
we are not told. We only know that these foreigners
received such bad treatment that they meditated
leaving the city in a body and setting up business
elsewhere. The fault was not altogether with the
citizens, it appears; for two Lombards were ordered
to be hanged.<a id="noteref_866" name="noteref_866" href="#note_866"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">866</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The king, who was at the time at Coventry—whither
the queen had caused him to be removed,
owing to her suspicion that the Londoners were in
favour of the Yorkist party—sent for alderman
Cantelowe,<a id="noteref_867" name="noteref_867" href="#note_867"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">867</span></span></a> a mercer, and promptly committed him
to Dudley Castle for safe keeping, as having been
implicated in the attack on the houses of the Italian
merchants.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This outbreak was followed by another "hurlynge"
between the mercers of the city and those
Lombards who had consented to remain in the city on
the understanding that they should be allowed to ply<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page293">[pg 293]</span><a name="Pg293" id="Pg293" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
their business without molestation until the council or
parliament should determine otherwise. In consequence
of this second outbreak no less than 28 mercers
were arrested and committed to Windsor Castle.<a id="noteref_868" name="noteref_868" href="#note_868"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">868</span></span></a></p>

Lichfield to the Mayor, reminding him of the dangers

an example to the rest of the kingdom, and enjoining
him that thenceforth he should allow no one to enter

the coast, the French made a descent in 1457,
and plundered Sandwich and Fowey, capturing over
30 ships, great and small, and doing much damage.
The citizens of London, to whom the protection of
their commerce in the "narrow sea," as the channel
was then frequently called, was everything, thereupon
took counsel among themselves, and made a proposal
to the king and to Bishop Waynflete, the chancellor,
to find 2,000 men and provisions for certain ships then
lying in the Thames, at their own expense, to join an
expedition to punish the enemy for their boldness.
The king thanked them for their patriotic spirit and
gave orders for a naval force to join the city contingent
from Hull.<a id="noteref_870" name="noteref_870" href="#note_870"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">870</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1458 Henry tried his hand at effecting a
reconciliation between the two rival sections of the
nobility, and to this end ordered a great council to
meet in St. Paul's on the 27th January. Warwick
left his post at Calais, and came over to London to
attend the meeting; but he did not arrive until more
than a month after the appointed day, and when he
came it was with a body of 600 men at his back,
"all apparyled in reed jakkettes, with whyte ragged
stavis."<a id="noteref_871" name="noteref_871" href="#note_871"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">871</span></span></a> He took up his quarters within the city,
where he found the Duke of York and the Earl of
Salisbury. The young Duke of Somerset and other
lords, who, like him, had lost their fathers at the
battle of St. Albans, were refused an entrance to the
city for fear of a breach of the peace, and had to find
accommodation outside the city's walls.<a id="noteref_872" name="noteref_872" href="#note_872"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">872</span></span></a> During the

all ended well. A grand pacification took place in
March, and was solemnized by an imposing procession
to St. Paul's, in which York led the queen by the
hand. The reconciliation thus effected was more
apparent than real, and neither party relaxed their
efforts to prepare for renewed hostility.</p>

the Earl of Warwick was implicated. A yeoman in
his suite picked a quarrel with one of the king's
servants and wounded him. Thereupon others of the
king's household, finding their fellow-servant wounded
and his enemy escaped, way-laid the earl and his
attendants as they left the council to take barge on
the river. By dint of hard hitting, the earl managed
to embark and to make his way to the city. But the
affray was not without bloodshed, and Warwick found
it convenient to withdraw soon afterwards to his post
at Calais, which thenceforth became the head-quarters
of the disaffected lords.</p>

Lord Audley, sent by the queen to arrest him, was

Later on, however, the earl and the Yorkist army

which, if continued, would be "the heaviest
charge and worst example that ever grew in England."
The city authorities appear to have rested their opposition
to the king's commission, not so much on the
grounds that they were unwilling to raise a force for his<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page298">[pg 298]</span><a name="Pg298" id="Pg298" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
assistance, as that a demand for military aid in such a
form might derogate from the city's franchise and
liberties. A deputation, consisting of two aldermen,
Thomas Urswyk, the Recorder, and one of the under-sheriffs,
was sent to Northampton to wait upon the
king and council and to explain the views of the
citizens in that respect. The interview was of a satisfactory
character; and the deputation returned bearing
a gracious letter from the king declaring that the City's
franchise and liberties should in no way be prejudiced
by the commission.<a id="noteref_884" name="noteref_884" href="#note_884"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">884</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 27th June, by which time news of their
arrival must have reached the city, a Common

solemnly promised to stand by the mayor and
aldermen in safe-guarding the city, and resist with all
their might the rebels against the lord the king who
were about to enter the city contrary to the king's
orders. The civic companies somewhat tardily gave
their adhesion to the royal cause, and agreed to
defend the city. The gates were ordered to be
manned, and no one was to be allowed to enter without
first saying who and what he was. Strict
enquiry was to be made as to the character of
strangers residing within each of their wards.<a id="noteref_888" name="noteref_888" href="#note_888"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">888</span></span></a> On

their way to Northampton, for the purpose of inducing
them, if possible, to turn aside and not approach
the city. The members were instructed to inform
the lords of the king's commands to the citizens
to hold the city for him, and to oppose the lords'
entry under heavy penalty. This instruction to the
deputation was given, we are told, with the approval
of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Bishops
of Norwich, Ely and Exeter, and of the Prior of St.
John's, Clerkenwell. The mayor, aldermen and commonalty
agreed to stand by any terms which the
deputation might be compelled to make. They had
not taken this step without first consulting the Lords
Scales and Hungerford, and Sir Edmund Hampden,
who held the Tower of London for King Henry.
The bridge gate was ordered to be closed between
nine and ten o'clock on the night of the 28th, and to
remain closed till the morning. Even the portcullis
was to be kept down if necessary, whilst the mayor
and sheriffs, with a certain number of armed men,
patrolled the city, and the aldermen kept watch in
their several wards.<a id="noteref_891" name="noteref_891" href="#note_891"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">891</span></span></a> Notwithstanding the next day
being Sunday, the critical state of affairs necessitated
a meeting of the Common Council. It was then
agreed that if any messenger should arrive from Warwick,
no communication should be held with him.
Special watches were appointed for the bridge and
for Billingsgate by night and day, and so anxious
were the authorities to avail themselves of the
service of every abled citizen on that Sunday, that
no one was allowed to attend Divine Service at St.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Up to this point the citizens had shown themselves
loyal to Henry. They now began to waver.
Early in the morning of the 30th June the mayor
and aldermen appear to have changed their minds.
The earls had sent them a letter and they resolved
to receive it. The contents of this letter are not
recorded. On the following day (1 July) another
communication from the earls was received. Here
again we are left in the dark as to its purport—the
City's journals at this period being very imperfect,—we
only know that they declined to accede to the request
to keep at a distance from London, for the very next

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The city was thus lost to the king; but the Tower
still held out, and no amount of eloquence on the
part of certain doctors of divinity, whom the Common
Council had appointed to try and arrange matters so

his companions to surrender it, although the garrison
was hard pressed for victuals.<a id="noteref_894" name="noteref_894" href="#note_894"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">894</span></span></a> Nothing was left but
to starve them out, and this the Earl of Salisbury
proceeded to do, with the aid of the citizens and the
boatmen on the river, by whom the Tower was
strictly invested by land and water. The Common
Council appear to have felt some qualms of conscience

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By the 10th July matters had become so serious
with the beleaguered garrison, that a letter was sent
to the Common Council, signed by the Earl of Kendal,
Lord Scales, Lord Hungerford, Lord Lovell and Sir
Edmund Hampden, asking why war was thus being
made upon them. To this the Council replied that
the lords had brought it upon themselves by firing
on the citizens in the first instance, and taking provisions
from them without payment.<a id="noteref_897" name="noteref_897" href="#note_897"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">897</span></span></a> At last the

After hearing arguments for and against his claim,
parliament arrived at a compromise by which the

It was otherwise with the proud and defiant Queen
Margaret. She was determined to acquiesce in no
such arrangement. Whilst she was collecting a force
in the north, wherewith to strike one blow for the
crown of which her son appeared likely to be robbed,
the mayor and aldermen held an extraordinary meeting
of the wardens of the livery companies. The
king wished to be assured of the temper of the citizens.
Would they as a body support him and his council,
protect his royal person, and defend the city against
those who were raising disturbances in divers parts of
the realm? To each and all of these questions the wardens
are recorded as having given satisfactory replies,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page304">[pg 304]</span><a name="Pg304" id="Pg304" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and it was then and there agreed that each alderman
should make enquiry as to the number of strangers
residing in his ward, and the reasons for their being
in the city. Watch was to be kept by night in every
ward, a lantern hung outside every dwelling-house,
and the city's gates were to be closed every night and
guarded by men-at-arms.<a id="noteref_903" name="noteref_903" href="#note_903"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">903</span></span></a> Although these measures

two unequal sections of the nobility, each avowing its

the two rival Houses of Lancaster and York.
Richard, Duke of York, did not live to enjoy the
crown, his right to the reversion of which had recently
been acknowledged by parliament. Just as the year
was drawing to a close he met his death at Wakefield
in the first clash with the House of Lancaster, and his
head in mockery was set up on one of the city's

queen wished for victuals to be sent from the city to
her forces at St. Albans, but the carts were seized
before they left the city by a mob which refused to
let them go in spite of the mayor's entreaties and
threats. Margaret's army consisted for the most part
of rude northern followers who threatened to sack
the city if once allowed within its walls, and the
majority of the inhabitants were unwilling to supply
the queen with provisions until she had removed her
half-disciplined force to a distance from London.
With a civilized army at her back it might have been
possible for Margaret to have gained a footing in the
city.<a id="noteref_905" name="noteref_905" href="#note_905"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">905</span></span></a> As matters stood, she deemed it best to accede

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In August, 1462 Calais was again in danger, and
the king wanted money. The Earl of Worcester and
others of the council were sent into the city to ask
for a loan of £3,400. After considering the matter,
the civic authorities agreed to lend him £1,000. The
money was to be raised by assessment on the wards,
but Dowgate ward being at the time very poor, was
not to be pressed.<a id="noteref_914" name="noteref_914" href="#note_914"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">914</span></span></a> In the following October the City
again came to the king's assistance with a further loan
of 2,000 marks,<a id="noteref_915" name="noteref_915" href="#note_915"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">915</span></span></a> and on the 9th November the City
obtained (in return, shall we say?) a charter confirming
its jurisdiction over the Borough of Southwark,<a id="noteref_916" name="noteref_916" href="#note_916"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">916</span></span></a>
originally granted by Edward III. Again, the coincidence
of a charter granted by the king to the City,
with a loan or gift from the City to the king, is remarkable.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Edward returned in February, 1463, from
the North, where he had succeeded with the assistance
afforded him by the Londoners in re-capturing most
of the castles which the restless Margaret had taken,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page309">[pg 309]</span><a name="Pg309" id="Pg309" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the City resolved to give him a befitting reception.
Preparations were made for the mayor, aldermen and
commons to ride forth to meet him in their finest
liveries, but the king having expressed his intention of
coming from Shene to the city by water, the citizens
went to meet him in their barges, with all the pomp
and ceremony of a Lord Mayor's day.<a id="noteref_917" name="noteref_917" href="#note_917"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">917</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Edward now gave himself up to a life of luxury
and pleasure. In 1464 he married the young widow
of Sir John Grey, better known by her maiden name
of Elizabeth Woodville. His marriage to her gave
offence to the nobility, more especially to the Earl of
Warwick, who was planning at the time a match with
France or Burgundy, and to whom the news of the
marriage with one so beneath the king in point of
dignity came as an unpleasant surprise. The earl
was still more offended when he learnt that the young
king had secretly effected a marriage treaty between
his sister Margaret (whom Warwick had destined for
one of the French princes) and the Duke of Burgundy.
These matrimonial alliances, combined with the inordinate
favour Edward displayed towards his wife's
family, led to an estrangement between the king and
his powerful subject.</p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">Alliance between England and Burgundy, 1468.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The proposed alliance with Burgundy was far
from being distasteful to the merchants of the city,
inasmuch as it was likely to open up trade with those
states of the Low Countries which the Burgundian
dukes had consolidated as a barrier against France.
When the Princess Margaret was about to start (June,
1468) for her future husband's dominions, the mayor<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page310">[pg 310]</span><a name="Pg310" id="Pg310" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and aldermen of London testified their appreciation
of the alliance by presenting her with a pair of silver
gilt dishes, weighing 19 lbs. 8 oz., besides the sum of
£100 in gold, by way of a wedding gift.<a id="noteref_918" name="noteref_918" href="#note_918"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">918</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Disgusted with the king's unhandsome conduct
towards him, Warwick found an ally in Clarence, the
king's brother, gave him one of his daughters in marriage,
and even encouraged him to hope for the
succession to the crown. Edward's extravagant and
luxurious life had lost him much of his popularity.
He had ceased, moreover, to possess the goodwill of
the citizens for having allowed the arrest of Sir Thomas
Cooke or Coke,<a id="noteref_919" name="noteref_919" href="#note_919"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">919</span></span></a> an alderman of the city, on a false
charge of treason. Notwithstanding his acquittal,
Cooke had been committed to prison and only
regained his liberty on payment of an extortionate
fine to the king and queen.<a id="noteref_920" name="noteref_920" href="#note_920"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">920</span></span></a> Warwick and Clarence
made use of the general discontent that prevailed to
further their own designs, and the civil war was
renewed. The City endeavoured to steer a middle
course. In June (1469) it lent the king the sum of
£200, but in the following month it lent Warwick and
Clarence just five times that amount on the sole
security of some jewels of little value.<a id="noteref_921" name="noteref_921" href="#note_921"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">921</span></span></a> In May, 1470,
when there seemed little hope of the jewels being
redeemed, as Warwick and Clarence had been obliged
to flee to France, the Common Council entertained
the thought of selling them for what they were worth.<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page311">[pg 311]</span><a name="Pg311" id="Pg311" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc174" id="toc174"></a>
The sale did not take place, however, but they were
kept some in the "Treasury," and some in the custody
of William Taillour, late mayor, on the express understanding
that he was not to be held responsible in the
event of their being stolen or taken by force.<a id="noteref_922" name="noteref_922" href="#note_922"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">922</span></span></a> In
February, 1471, when the wheel of fortune had once
more placed Henry VI on the throne from which
he had been driven by Edward, and Warwick and
Clarence were again in power, the mayor and aldermen
caused it to be placed on record that the
loan on the jewels had been made by agreement of
the whole court, with the assistance of certain commoners
who had been called in to contribute. What
their object was in so doing is not clear. Perhaps
they felt some qualms as to what Edward might say
or do in respect of the loan, should he again return to
power. They, at the same time, extended the time
for the repayment of the loan, at the desire of the
dukes of Clarence and Warwick. If the jewels were
not redeemed by Whitsuntide at the latest, they were
to be sold.<a id="noteref_923" name="noteref_923" href="#note_923"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">923</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whilst Warwick and Clarence were in France in
1470, they concerted measures with Queen Margaret
for effecting another revolution. By September
matters were ready for execution. On the 13th
Warwick landed in England; and before the end of
the month the Kentish men so threatened the City
and Westminster, that the newly-elected sheriffs had
to be escorted by an armed force in order to be sworn
in at the Exchequer, whilst a constant patrol was kept
in the streets.<a id="noteref_924" name="noteref_924" href="#note_924"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">924</span></span></a> On the 1st October it was made
known in the city that the king had taken flight.<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page312">[pg 312]</span><a name="Pg312" id="Pg312" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
His queen took sanctuary at Westminster, leaving the
Tower in the hands of the mayor and aldermen and
members of the council of Warwick and Clarence.
The unfortunate Henry was quickly removed from
the wretched cell in which he had so long been confined
to a commodious and handsomely furnished
apartment which the queen herself, being <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">enceinte</span></span> at
the time, purposed occupying when she should be
brought to bed. A garrison was placed in the Tower
by order of the Common Council, sitting, for safety's
sake, in the church of St. Stephen, Walbrook. On the
5th October Archbishop Nevill, Warwick's brother,
entered the city with a strong force and relieved the
civic authorities of the custody of the Tower, and on
the following day Warwick himself appeared, accompanied
by Clarence and a large following, and removed
Henry from the Tower to the Bishop of London's
palace.<a id="noteref_925" name="noteref_925" href="#note_925"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">925</span></span></a> Two days later (9 Oct.) he obtained from
the Common Council the sum of £1,000 for the
defence of his stronghold, Calais, besides a loan of
£100 from the aldermen of the city for his own
private use.<a id="noteref_926" name="noteref_926" href="#note_926"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">926</span></span></a> On the 18th the Earl of Worcester,

beheaded on Tower Hill, the ground being kept by

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In November Henry was made to hold a parliament,
and Sir Thomas Cooke, the deposed alderman,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page313">[pg 313]</span><a name="Pg313" id="Pg313" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc175" id="toc175"></a>
lost no time in presenting a bill for the restoration of
his lands, which had been seized by the queen's father,
Lord Rivers. He would probably have been successful
had fortune continued to favour King Henry, for,
besides being a member of parliament, he was, writes
Fabyan (a brother alderman), "a man of great boldnesse
in speche, and well spoken and syngulerly
wytted and well reasoned."<a id="noteref_929" name="noteref_929" href="#note_929"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">929</span></span></a> John Stokton had
recently been elected mayor, but there is reason for
believing that he, like other aldermen, preferred
Edward on the throne, licentious and extravagant
as he was, to an imbecile like Henry. He fell ill,
or, as Fabyan puts it, feigned sickness and took
to his bed, and Cooke assumed the duties of the
mayoralty. At Edward's restoration Cooke had to
seek refuge in France, but he was taken at sea before
he could reach the continent. The same fate might
have awaited Stokton had he shown himself less
cautious at that critical time.</p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">Edward recovers the throne, April, 1471.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That the aldermen and the better class of citizens
favoured Edward, is shown by the ease with which
he effected an entry into the city when he returned
to England in the spring of the following year (1471).
The gates, we are told, were opened to him by
Urswyk, the Recorder, and certain aldermen (their
names are not mentioned), who took advantage of
the inhabitants being at dinner to let in Edward.<a id="noteref_930" name="noteref_930" href="#note_930"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">930</span></span></a>
Two days later, having recruited his forces, Edward<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page314">[pg 314]</span><a name="Pg314" id="Pg314" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
marched out of the city, with Henry in his train, to
meet Warwick. He encountered him on Easter Day
(14 April) at Barnet, and totally defeated him, both
the earl and his brother being left dead on the field.
By this time Margaret had landed with a fresh army;
but a crushing defeat inflicted upon her at Tewkesbury
(4 May) left Edward once more master of the
kingdom.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For a short time the city lay in some peril whilst
Edward was engaged with Warwick and Margaret.
The men of Kent again became troublesome. They
affected not to believe that Warwick had actually
fallen at Barnet. Under the leadership of Thomas
Fauconberg or Falconbridge, generally spoken of as
the "bastard," being a natural son of William Nevill,
first Lord Fauconberg, Earl of Kent, they marched to
London, with the intention of releasing Henry from
confinement and placing him again on the throne.
Fauconberg, who had been made a freeman of the
City in 1454,<a id="noteref_931" name="noteref_931" href="#note_931"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">931</span></span></a> assumed the title of captain of King
Henry's people in Kent, and on the 8th May wrote
from Sittingbourne to inform the inhabitants of the
city that he had undertaken the cause of Henry
against the "usurper" Edward, and to ask to be
allowed to pass through the city with his followers,
whom he promised to hold in restraint and prevent
doing any mischief. He had written to the mayor
and aldermen to the same effect, and had desired to
have a reply sent to him at Blackheath by a certain
day and hour. To this letter the mayor and aldermen
sent an answer on the following day, to the effect
that when Edward left the city, after the battle of<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page315">[pg 315]</span><a name="Pg315" id="Pg315" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc176" id="toc176"></a>
Barnet, to follow the movements of Margaret and
endeavour to bring about an action before she could
completely rally her forces, he had charged them on
their allegiance to hold the city of London for him,
and for none other. For that reason they dared not,
neither would they, suffer him to pass through the
city. They hesitated to accept his assurance as to
the peaceable behaviour of his followers, judging from
past experience. As for the statement he had caused
to be published, that he held a commission as captain
of the Navy of England and men of war by sea and
land under the Earl of Warwick, whom he still supposed
to be alive, they assured him that the earl was
dead, and that his corpse, as well as the corpse of
Montague, the earl's brother, had been exposed to
view for two days in St. Paul's. They gave him the
names of some of the chief men who had fallen at
Tewkesbury, obtained, they assured him, not from
hearsay but from eye-witnesses—special war correspondents,
whom the City had despatched for the
express purpose of reporting on the state of the field,
and they concluded by exhorting him to do as they
themselves had done, and to acknowledge Edward IV
as the rightful king. They would even plead for royal
favour on his behalf, but as to letting him and his host
pass through the city, that was out of the question.<a id="noteref_932" name="noteref_932" href="#note_932"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">932</span></span></a>
Having despatched this answer to Fauconberg, the
civic fathers at once set to work to fortify the river's
bank from Castle Baynard to the Tower, where lay
the rebels' fleet. On Sunday, the 12th May, the
Kentish men tried to force London Bridge and set<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page316">[pg 316]</span><a name="Pg316" id="Pg316" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
fire to some beer-houses near Saint Katherine's
Hospital. The attack was renewed on the following
Tuesday, whilst portions of the rebel force, amounting
it was said to 5,000 persons, were told off to try and
force the gates of Aldgate and Bishopsgate. There,
however, they were repulsed, and nearly 300 of them
met their death, either in actual fight or in their
endeavours to get on board their boats at Blackwall.
Urswyk, the city's Recorder, as well as Robert Basset,
alderman of Aldgate Ward, showed conspicuous valour
in the fight which took place in that quarter.<a id="noteref_933" name="noteref_933" href="#note_933"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">933</span></span></a> The
city was never again troubled by Fauconberg. After
much wandering he was taken prisoner at Southampton,
and thence conveyed to Middleham, in Yorkshire,
where he was beheaded. His head was afterwards
sent to London and set up on London Bridge, "looking
into Kentward."<a id="noteref_934" name="noteref_934" href="#note_934"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">934</span></span></a></p>

murdered, in all probability, at the instance of the
Duke of Gloucester, the king's brother, afterwards

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The rest of Edward's reign was undisturbed by
any attempt to unseat the new dynasty, and his position
was rendered the more secure by the birth of
a son (afterwards Edward V) in the sanctuary of Westminster,
whither his wife Elizabeth had fled for refuge.
Before the young Prince of Wales was five years old
he received the honour of knighthood at Westminster.
The mayor and aldermen went to meet him on his
way from the city to Westminster on that occasion,
clad in scarlet robes, whilst the streets from Bishopsgate
to Saint Paul's were thronged with the commons in
their livery.<a id="noteref_939" name="noteref_939" href="#note_939"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">939</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Edward was now free to carry out his foreign
policy. Parliament voted supplies to enable him to
make war with France, but these were not sufficient,
and he had recourse to a system of "benevolences"
or free gifts, which few, however, dared to refuse. On
the 30th May, 1475, he left the Bishop of London's
palace in St. Paul's Church-yard, and, passing through
Cheapside to London Bridge, took boat to Greenwich
for the purpose of crossing over to France. The
livery companies turned out to do him honour.<a id="noteref_940" name="noteref_940" href="#note_940"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">940</span></span></a> The

himself to be bought off with a sum of 75,000 crowns

return he was met at Blackheath by the mayor
and aldermen in scarlet gowns, with their servants in

600 members of the companies in gowns of bright

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By resorting again to benevolences and exacting
money from the City in return for charters, Edward
avoided the necessity of summoning parliament between
the years 1478 and 1483. On the 25th May,
1481, the king granted the City a general pardon,<a id="noteref_942" name="noteref_942" href="#note_942"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">942</span></span></a> and

only repaid, but the king in the next year extended

regaling them and their wives with venison and
wine.<a id="noteref_944" name="noteref_944" href="#note_944"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">944</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The close of the year 1482 witnessed such a
dearth of cereals that the exportation of wheat or
other grain was absolutely forbidden. It was feared
that a famine might arise in the City of London, so
vast had its population become, both from the influx
of nobles who had taken up their quarters within its
walls as well as of strangers from foreign lands.
Merchants were therefore encouraged to send their

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The coronation of the young prince who now
succeeded to his father's throne, only to occupy it however
for a few weeks, was fixed to take place on the first
Sunday in May; and on the 19th April the City was
busy making arrangements for the prince's reception.
It was decided that the mayor and aldermen should
ride forth to meet the king, clad in gowns of scarlet,
their attendants being provided with gowns of the
colour of lion's-foot (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pied de lyon</span></span>), at the public cost.
Five sergeants-at-mace belonging to the mayor, and
nineteen sergeants-at-mace in the service of the
sheriffs, were also to ride out to meet the king, clad
in gowns of the last-mentioned colour. The sword-bearer
was to be provided with a gown of murrey, and
a deputation from the civic guilds, to the number of
410 persons, clad in gowns of the same colour, was to
join the cavalcade.<a id="noteref_949" name="noteref_949" href="#note_949"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">949</span></span></a> On the 14th May they rode out<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page320">[pg 320]</span><a name="Pg320" id="Pg320" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to Hornsey, where they met the prince and his uncle,
the Duke of Gloucester, and escorted them to the
city. The duke was the same day appointed Protector,
to the great disappointment of the queen, who again
took sanctuary at Westminster. She was induced
shortly afterwards to give up possession of her younger
son, the Duke of York, and he and Prince Edward
were lodged in the Tower by order of Gloucester, who
took up his quarters at Crosby Palace, the mansion
house of Sir John Crosby, in Bishopsgate Street.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Although preparations had been made for the
coronation, and the City had appointed representatives
from the livery companies to assist the chief butler at
the banquet<a id="noteref_950" name="noteref_950" href="#note_950"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">950</span></span></a> according to custom, that ceremony
never took place. Gloucester feared that if once the
young king was crowned, the project which he had
already begun to entertain of transferring the crown
to his own head would be less capable of realization.
Although he took an oath of allegiance to the new
king,<a id="noteref_951" name="noteref_951" href="#note_951"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">951</span></span></a> it was not long before he determined to feel the
pulse of the citizens as to their feelings towards himself
as a claimant of the crown.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In order to do this he called to his assistance
Dr. Shaw, an eminent preacher, whose brother, Sir
Edmund Shaa, or Shaw, happened to be mayor at the
time. Acting upon instructions from Gloucester,
Shaw preached a sermon at Paul's Cross on Sunday,
the 22nd June (1483), in which he charged the late
king with bigamy, Edward IV having, as he declared,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page321">[pg 321]</span><a name="Pg321" id="Pg321" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc179" id="toc179"></a>
made a contract of marriage with one of his mistresses
before he married Elizabeth Woodville, and this being
the case the late king's children by her were illegitimate,
and Gloucester was the rightful heir to the
throne. It was arranged that at this point in his
discourse Gloucester himself should appear on the
scene, coming up, as if by chance, from his lodgings
at Castle Baynard. By some mischance the duke
failed to appear at the proper moment, and the effect
was lost. The citizens sat stolidly silent, not a single
cry being raised in favour of Gloucester.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nothing daunted by this dismal failure, Gloucester
made another and more successful attempt to win over
the citizens. On the following Tuesday (24 June) he
sent the Duke of Buckingham to harangue the citizens
at the Guildhall. The duke began by reminding his
hearers of the danger to which their wives and
daughters had been exposed under the late king; of
the undue influence exercised at court by Jane Shore,<a id="noteref_952" name="noteref_952" href="#note_952"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">952</span></span></a>
one only of a number of respectable women whom
Edward, he said, had seduced; of the excessive taxes
and illegal extortions by way of "benevolences" they
had recently suffered, and of the cruel treatment of
their own alderman, Cooke. He then went on to
repeat the remarks of Dr. Shaw touching the illegitimacy
of the princes, and spoke of the dangers of<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page322">[pg 322]</span><a name="Pg322" id="Pg322" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
having a boy king on the throne, concluding by saying
that although it were doubtful if Gloucester would
accept the crown if asked, he would certainly be
greatly influenced by any request proceeding from
the "worshipful citizens of the metropolis of the
kingdom."<a id="noteref_953" name="noteref_953" href="#note_953"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">953</span></span></a> Buckingham's eloquence was lost on the
citizens, who were as little influenced by what their
new Recorder, Thomas Fitz-William, had to say on
the matter. At length the duke lost patience and
plainly told them that the matter lay entirely with
the lords and commons, and that the assent of the
citizens, however desirable in itself, was not a necessity.
By this time the back of the hall was packed
with Gloucester's partisans, so that when Buckingham
put the question pointedly to the assembly—would
they have the Protector assume the crown?—a
cry of assent arose from this quarter and was taken up
by a few lads and apprentices. This was enough; the
voice of the few was accepted as the voice of the
many, and the citizens were bidden to attend on the
morrow to petition Gloucester to accept the crown.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Accordingly, on the morrow, a deputation from
the city waited on the Duke of Gloucester at Baynard's
Castle and invited him to accept the crown.
After a considerable show of affected reluctance,
Richard assented, and, having assented, lost no time
in carrying out his pre-conceived purpose. The very
next day he hastened to Westminster and, seating
himself on the throne, declared himself king by inheritance
and election.</p>

reigned over England was crowned—crowned with
his wife Anne, widow of Prince Edward, killed at
Tewkesbury, but after the battle not in it, and of
whose blood Richard himself is thought to have been
guilty. The City accepted the position and made
the new king and queen a present of £1,000; two-thirds
for the king and the remainder for the queen.
The money was raised in the city by way of a
fifteenth; the poor were not to be called upon to contribute,
and the gift was not to form a precedent.<a id="noteref_954" name="noteref_954" href="#note_954"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">954</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This extract is interesting as showing that the
coronation cup presented to the mayor of the City
by way of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">honorarium</span></span> was, at this period at least,
looked upon as a gift made to the City's use, and
that the mayor could not claim it as his own perquisite,
as mayors had been in the habit of doing in
days gone by, and as they continued to do afterwards.
William Estfeld, who, as mayor, attended the coronation
of Henry VI (6 Nov., 1429), and received the
customary gold cup and ewer, appropriated the gift
to his own use, and, as we have already mentioned,
bequeathed them to his grandson.</p>

on the throne before the Duke of Buckingham, who
had been rewarded for his late services by being
appointed lord high constable, was in open rebellion,
and Henry, Earl of Richmond, long an exile in France,
was meditating an invasion. Buckingham's conspiracy
proved a failure, and he paid for his rashness with his
head. The Earl of Richmond was detained in France
by stress of weather, and danger from that quarter
was averted at least for a time.</p>

Petition which the citizens presented to him setting

"rather to adventure and to commit us to the peril

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Richard met this appeal by summoning parliament
to meet in January (1484), when various acts
were passed affecting the trade and commerce of the
city and the country, and among them one which
forbade aliens keeping any foreign apprentices or

otherwise imposed great restrictions upon the merchant
stranger.<a id="noteref_960" name="noteref_960" href="#note_960"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">960</span></span></a> This statute was scarcely less welcome

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the summer he was welcomed wherever he
went, yet he knew that danger threatened. Richmond
was preparing for an invasion and the nobles were not
to be trusted. The citizens, too, were aware of the
danger, and had in the early part of the year appointed
a joint committee of aldermen and commoners to survey
the city's ordnance, and to supply guns and gunpowder
in place of that which had recently been
destroyed by a fire.<a id="noteref_962" name="noteref_962" href="#note_962"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">962</span></span></a> In August they had promised<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page326">[pg 326]</span><a name="Pg326" id="Pg326" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A cloud soon overshadowed the rejoicings which
followed Henry's accession. An epidemic hitherto unknown
in England, although visitations of it followed
at intervals during this and the succeeding reign, made
its appearance in the city towards the close of September.
The "sweating sickness," as this deadly<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page327">[pg 327]</span><a name="Pg327" id="Pg327" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
pestilence was called, carried off two mayors and six

fatal was its attack. Sir Thomas Hille, who was
mayor at the time of its first appearance, fell a victim
to it on the 23rd September, and was succeeded by
William Stocker, appointed on the following day.<a id="noteref_970" name="noteref_970" href="#note_970"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">970</span></span></a>
Within four days Stocker himself was dead. There
remained little more than a month before the regular
day of election of a mayor (28 Oct.)<a id="noteref_971" name="noteref_971" href="#note_971"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">971</span></span></a> for the year
ensuing, and John Warde was called upon to take office
during the interval.<a id="noteref_972" name="noteref_972" href="#note_972"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">972</span></span></a> He appears to have entertained

had some difficulty in getting him to reside in London,<a id="noteref_973" name="noteref_973" href="#note_973"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">973</span></span></a>
where his duties required his presence. When the
mayoralty year expired he was not put in nomination
for re-election. He probably went back into
the country, glad to get away from the pestilential
city, and Hugh Brice was elected in his stead.<a id="noteref_974" name="noteref_974" href="#note_974"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">974</span></span></a>
Fortunately for the city, the epidemic departed as
suddenly and unexpectedly as it came. By the end
of October it had entirely disappeared, and allowed
of Henry's coronation taking place on the 30th of
that month.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Within a fortnight of his arrival in London
Henry issued a writ of summons for his first parliament.
It was not so much for the purpose of obtaining
supplies that he was anxious that parliament should
meet at the earliest opportunity; he was desirous of<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page328">[pg 328]</span><a name="Pg328" id="Pg328" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
obtaining as soon as possible a parliamentary title to
the crown. As for his immediate necessities, he preferred
to apply to the City. He asked for a loan of
6,000 marks, or £4,000; but the citizens would not
advance more than half that sum. The loan was repaid
the following year—"every penie to the good

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A rumour that the Earl of Warwick had escaped
from the Tower gave an opportunity for an imposter,
Lambert Simnel, to personate the earl. In order to
satisfy the Londoners that the rumour of Warwick's
escape was a fabrication, Henry caused his prisoner to be
paraded through the streets of the city, and exposed to
public view at St. Paul's. After Simnel's defeat (16 June,

and see Brittany overwhelmed by the French king.
Before assistance could be sent to the Duchess Anne,
it was imperative that money should be raised. At
the close of 1488 the Common Council voted the king
a loan of £4,000. The money was ordered to be
raised by assessment on the companies, but the practice
was not to be drawn into precedent. The king,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page330">[pg 330]</span><a name="Pg330" id="Pg330" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

immediately made to assist him in his expedition by
parliament; whilst the City contributed a "great benevolence,"
the fellowship of Drapers contributing
more than any other fellowship, and every alderman

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The success which, brief as it was, had attended
Simnel's enterprise was sufficient to encourage a hope
that a better planned project might end in overturning
the throne. A report was accordingly blazed abroad
that Richard, Duke of York, brother of King Edward V,
was yet alive, not having been murdered in the Tower,
as had been supposed; and a man called Perkin Warbeck
or Warboys, a native of Tournay, assumed the
name of Richard Plantagenet and succeeded in getting
a large number of people in Ireland and Scotland to
believe that in his person they in fact saw Richard,
Duke of York, the rightful heir to the crown.
James IV of Scotland not only gave him in marriage
the lady Catherine Gordon, daughter of the Earl of
Huntley, but led an army into England in hopes that
the appearance of the pretended prince might raise
an insurrection in the northern counties. Instead,
however, of joining the invaders the English prepared
to repel them, and James retreated into his own
country. This took place in 1496. Parliament granted
large supplies to enable the king to meet the danger,
but the inhabitants of Cornwall, sick of the constant
demands made of them for money, and aware of the
large treasure which Henry had already amassed,
openly resisted any attempt at further taxation and
determined to march on London.</p>

armed men in addition to his usual suite, and the

assist them in keeping the peace within the city.
Communication was to be kept up at least once in
the day between the mayor and the Lord Chancellor.
Houses which had been set up on the city's walls, or

the rest were for the most part made prisoners, but were
soon afterwards dismissed without further punishment.
The leniency displayed towards them by Henry was<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page333">[pg 333]</span><a name="Pg333" id="Pg333" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc184" id="toc184"></a>
ill-repaid by their afterwards flocking to the standard
of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">soi-disant</span></span> Richard IV, King of England, who
availed himself of their mutinous disposition and
appeared in their midst at Bodmin. The news of
Perkin Warbeck having arrived in Cornwall from
Ireland was brought to the mayor and aldermen of
the City of London by letter from the king, which was
read to the Common Council on Saturday, the 16th
September.<a id="noteref_993" name="noteref_993" href="#note_993"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">993</span></span></a> The rebels made an unsuccesful attempt
to get possession of Exeter, but hearing of the approach
of the king's forces, Perkin Warbeck withdrew to
Taunton, leaving his followers to take care of themselves.
From Taunton he went to "Mynet" (Minehead)
accompanied by less than sixty adherents,<a id="noteref_994" name="noteref_994" href="#note_994"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">994</span></span></a> and
by the 12th October the king was able to inform
the Mayor that Peter "Warboys" had voluntarily
submitted himself and had confessed to his being
a native of Tournay.<a id="noteref_995" name="noteref_995" href="#note_995"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">995</span></span></a> The king had him conveyed
to London and paraded through the streets
on horseback, in a species of mock triumph, and
caused his confession to be printed and scattered over
the country that people might see the real character
of the man. For a time he appears to have been
detained in lax custody about the court, but after he
had made an attempt to escape and reach the sea-coast,
and been re-captured, he was sent to the Tower.
There he got into communication with the unfortunate
Earl of Warwick, and entered into a plot for effecting
his own and the earl's liberty. A charge was formulated
against the earl on the most trivial grounds, of a
conspiracy to seize the Tower, and Warbeck was
indicted as an accomplice. The former, being found<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page334">[pg 334]</span><a name="Pg334" id="Pg334" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
guilty by his peers, was beheaded on Tower Hill,

at Tyburn.<a id="noteref_996" name="noteref_996" href="#note_996"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">996</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The removal of Warwick—"the one judicial

was an act which could not be otherwise than grateful

had been proceeding for a marriage between Prince
Arthur and Catherine of Aragon. Warwick's death
cleared away the last of Henry's serious competitors,
and "not a doubtful drop of royal blood" remained
in the kingdom to oppose Arthur's claim to the
succession. The princess was expected shortly to
arrive in England, and a committee composed of
aldermen and commoners was appointed (Nov. 1499)
to consult with the king's commissioners as to the
preparations to be made for her reception.<a id="noteref_999" name="noteref_999" href="#note_999"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">999</span></span></a> Nearly
two years, however, elapsed before she set foot in

In the following month the streets presented a

the King of the Romans. Bonfires were ordered to be
lighted at nine different places, and at each of them
was to be placed a hogshead of wine, with two
sergeants and two sheriffs' yeomen to prevent disturbance;
but seeing that it was the Lenten season
and that the queen had so recently died, there was to
be no minstrelsy. The City Chamberlain was instructed
to provide a certain quantity of "Ipocras,"
claret, Rhenish wine and Muscatel, besides comfits
and wafers, and two pots of "Succade" and green

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Henry's chief merit was that he established order,
and for this the citizens were grateful. This improvement
on the weak government of his immediate predecessors
had only been carried out, however, at the
cost of extension of royal power, and the City was
made to suffer with the rest of the kingdom. In
1503 the civic authorities were deprived by statute
of their control over the livery companies,<a id="noteref_1007" name="noteref_1007" href="#note_1007"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1007</span></span></a> and in the
same year the Tailors of London obtained a charter
which gave umbrage to the mayor and aldermen of
the City, as ousting them of their jurisdiction. The
Tailors maintained their independence, and their wardens
are expressly mentioned as refusing to join the
Mercers, Grocers, Drapers, Fishmongers, Goldsmiths
and other fraternities in a petition to parliament
(1512) for placing them formally under the rule of

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Henry continued his high-handed policy towards
the City up to the day of his death, and thereby
greatly increased his treasure. His chief instruments
were Empson and Dudley, who took up their residence
in the city, occupying two houses in Walbrook,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page338">[pg 338]</span><a name="Pg338" id="Pg338" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

used to meet and concert measures for filling the
king's purse and their own. In 1506 Henry removed
Robert Johnson, a goldsmith, from the shrievalty

William Capel, Alderman of Walbrook Ward, who

extortion he went to prison, and remained there

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime the Archduke Philip happened
to fall into Henry's hands (Jan., 1506). Whilst
crossing the sea to claim the kingdom of Castile<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page339">[pg 339]</span><a name="Pg339" id="Pg339" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc187" id="toc187"></a>
in right of his wife, he was driven by stress of
weather into Weymouth. Henry was too shrewd a
politician not to make the most of so lucky an event,
and detained him in a species of honourable captivity,
until Philip had promised him the hand of his sister
Margaret with a large dower. This marriage alliance
was destined never to be realised. Another scheme,
however, was subsequently proposed and met with
more success. This was a marriage of Henry's own
daughter with Philip's son Charles, Prince of Castile.
News of their engagement was conveyed to the
mayor and aldermen of the City by a letter from the
king himself (25 Dec., 1507), in which he expatiated
on the benefits, political and commercial, likely to
arise from the match.<a id="noteref_1016" name="noteref_1016" href="#note_1016"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1016</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This letter was followed by another from the king,
dated from Greenwich, the 23rd June following, in
which the Corporation was informed that for the assurance
of execution of the marriage treaty both parties
had given pledges, and that the City of London was,
among other cities and towns, included in letters
obligatory to that effect, which letters he begged
should be sealed without delay with the Common Seal
of the City.<a id="noteref_1017" name="noteref_1017" href="#note_1017"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1017</span></span></a> And so, after the manner of the times,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If Henry amassed wealth, it was not from any
miserly motive. He well knew the value of the
money, and that peace at home was never better
secured than by a full treasury. He made, moreover,
a princely use of his money, encouraging scholarship,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page340">[pg 340]</span><a name="Pg340" id="Pg340" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Originally intended by Henry as a resting place
for the remains of his uncle, Henry VI, the last mentioned
edifice was diverted from its purposes and became
the chantry as well as the tomb of Henry VII
himself. Anxiety for his soul caused him to bind the
Abbot of Westminster by heavy penalties to the due
observance of his obit. These penalties were set out
in six books or deeds, sealed with the Common Seal of
the City of London, and formally delivered to the king
by a deputation of the mayor and aldermen, who received
in return a seventh book to remain in their
custody. In 1504—the year that Pope Julius sanctioned
the removal of the remains of Henry VI from
Windsor to Westminster—the mayor and citizens
formally sealed the "books" before the Master of the
Rolls at the Guildhall. Two years later certain livery
companies undertook to keep the king's obit on the

conveyed from Richmond to St. Paul's on the 9th
May, being met on its way at St. George's Bar, in
Southwark, by the mayor, aldermen and a suite of
104 commoners, all in black clothing and all on horseback.
The streets were lined with other members of
the companies bearing torches, the lowest craft occupying
the first place. Next after the freemen of the
city came the "strangers"—Easterlings, Frenchmen,
Spaniards, Venetians, Genoese, Florentines and
"Lukeners"—on horseback and on foot, also bearing
torches.<a id="noteref_1022" name="noteref_1022" href="#note_1022"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1022</span></span></a> These took up their position in Gracechurch
Street. Cornhill was occupied by the lower crafts,
ordered in such a way that "the most worshipful
crafts" stood next unto "Paules." A similar order
was preserved the next day, when the corpse was
removed from Saint Paul's to Westminster. The
lowest crafts were placed nearest to the Cathedral,
and the most worshipful next to Temple Bar, where
the civic escort terminated. The mayor and aldermen
proceeded to Westminster by water, to attend the
"masse and offering." The mayor, with his mace in
his hand, made his offering next after the Lord
Chamberlain; those aldermen who had passed the

and to offer restitution to all who had suffered at the
hands of Empson and Dudley or their agents. Empson
and Dudley were themselves committed to the
Tower and afterwards executed. In the meantime
an enquiry was opened in the city as to recent proceedings
against Capel and others.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was found that six men, whose names were
John Derby, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">alias</span></span> Wright, a bowyer, Richard Smyth,
a carpenter, William Sympson, a fuller, Henry Stokton,
a fishmonger, Thomas Yong, a saddler, and
Robert Jakes, a shearman—all of whom had more
than once been convicted of perjury, and on that
account been struck off inquests—had contrived to get
themselves replaced on the panel, and had been the
chief movers in the recent actions against the late
mayor and other officers of the city. They had,
moreover, taken bribes for concealment of offences of
forestalling and regrating. Being found guilty, on
their own confession, of having brought false charges
against many of the aldermen, the Court of Common
Council adjudged the whole of the accused to be
disfranchised. Three of them, who were found more<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page344">[pg 344]</span><a name="Pg344" id="Pg344" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
guilty than the rest, were sentenced to be taken from
prison on the next market day, on horseback, without
saddles, and with their faces turned towards the horses'
tails, to the pillory on Cornhill. There they were to
be set "their heddes in the holys" until proclamation
of their crime and sentence was read. The lesser
offenders were spared the pillory, but were condemned
to attend on horseback at Cornhill, whence all the
offenders were conducted to the Standard in Fleet
Street "by the most high ways," where the proclamation
was again read. The culprits were then taken
back to prison and made to abjure the city on pain of
imprisonment at the pleasure of the mayor and

Derby was one to the effect that being on a jury he
had received the sum of ten shillings and "a quarter

took place on Midsummer-day soon after his marriage
with Catherine of Aragon, his brother's widow, the
citizens presented the king and queen with the sum
of £1,000 or 1,500 marks. Two-thirds of the gift
was given expressly to the king, the remaining one-third
being a tribute of respect to the queen. The
money was to be raised in the city by way of a
fifteenth, but the poor were not to be assessed.<a id="noteref_1029" name="noteref_1029" href="#note_1029"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1029</span></span></a> The

been witnessed in the city for its gorgeousness and

with base and meane occupations and so
ascending to the worshipful crafts." The Goldsmiths
of London were especially conspicuous for their marks
of loyalty on that day. Their stalls, which were
situate by the Old Change at the west end of Chepe,
were occupied by fair maidens dressed in white and
holding tapers of white wax, whilst priests in their

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After three years of indolent and luxurious ease
Henry became embroiled in continental troubles. In
1511 a holy league had been formed for the purpose
of driving the French out of the Milanese, and
Henry's co-operation was desired. A parliament was

war should be proclaimed against France. The campaign

king threatened to turn the tables on Henry and to
invade England. Henry rose to the occasion and at
once set about strengthening his navy. On the
30th January, 1513, he addressed a letter to the Corporation
of London desiring them to furnish him
with 300 men, the same to be at Greenwich by the
15th February at the latest.<a id="noteref_1034" name="noteref_1034" href="#note_1034"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1034</span></span></a> Proclamation was
thereupon made in the city for all persons who were
prepared to join the war to appear at the Guildhall
any time before the 10th February, where, if approved,
they would be furnished with sufficient harness and
weapons, without any charge, and also with sufficient
wages at the king's cost.<a id="noteref_1035" name="noteref_1035" href="#note_1035"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1035</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The city was suffering at the time from great
scarcity of wheat, and each alderman was called upon
to contribute the sum of £5 towards alleviating the
distress which prevailed. A contract was made with
certain Hanse merchants to furnish the city with 2,000
quarters of wheat and rye respectively by Midsummer-day,
whilst the royal purveyors were forbidden to
lay hands on wheat, malt or grain entering the port
of London.<a id="noteref_1036" name="noteref_1036" href="#note_1036"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1036</span></span></a> Under the circumstances it could have
been no great hardship, but rather an advantage to rid
the city of 300 mouths. On the 1st February, 1513,
the aldermen were instructed to enquire in their
respective wards as to the number of men each ward
could furnish, and two days later the livery companies
were ordered to find the sum of £300 to defray the
expense connected with fitting out the men. If more
than £300 were needed they were to draw on the
Chamber, but any money not expended out of that<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page347">[pg 347]</span><a name="Pg347" id="Pg347" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc193" id="toc193"></a>

respectively £30, and the rest sums of smaller

the nature of the uniform to be worn by the city's
contingent. At length it was settled that the soldiers'
coats should be white, with a St. George's cross and
sword, together with a rose, at the back and the same
before. Their shoes were to be left to the discretion
of the muster-masters.<a id="noteref_1039" name="noteref_1039" href="#note_1039"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1039</span></span></a></p>

campaign proved more successful than the last, for
the French being attacked at Guinegate, were seized
with so great a panic that Henry achieved a bloodless
victory. From the hasty flight of the French cavalry,
the engagement came to be known as the Battle of
Spurs. This victory secured the fall of Terouenne
and was followed shortly afterwards by the capture
of Tournay.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Notwithstanding these successes, however, Henry
found it necessary to make peace in the following
year. His allies had got what they wanted, and the
conquest of France was as far off as ever. It
remained only to make as good a bargain as he could.
The French king consented to the payment of a large
sum of money, in return for which he was given
Henry's sister Mary in marriage, although she was
already affianced, if not married, to Prince Charles
of Castile. This was the work of the king's new
minister, Wolsey.</p>

revival of letters which commenced in the last reign
came to be called—to Erasmus, to Archbishop
Warham, to More and to Colet, the war at its outset
had been eminently distasteful. With the accession

education in the city at St. Antony's School in Threadneedle

pupils the famous Whitgift. Later in life he shut
himself up for four years in the Charterhouse of
London, living a life of devotion and prayer, but
without taking any vow.<a id="noteref_1041" name="noteref_1041" href="#note_1041"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1041</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Up to the time of Henry VI education had been

in several parishes. The school of St. Antony
attached to the hospital of the same name, of which
Dr. John Carpenter was at the time master, received
an endowment from Henry VI for the maintenance of
scholars at Oxford. The school continued to flourish
some time after the dissolution of the hospital. There
was also a school attached to the hospital of St.
Thomas of Acon, as famous in its day as that of
St. Antony, but of which little is known until after the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Dr. John Carpenter just mentioned must not
be confounded with the Town Clerk of that name,
the compiler of the famous <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Liber Albus</span></span> and the
founder of the City of London School. There is little
known of the foundation of this latter school beyond
the statement made by Stow a century and a-half
later, that he "gave tenements to the city for the
finding and bringing up of four poor men's children
with meat, drink, apparel, learning at the schools in
the universities, etc., until they be preferred, and<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page350">[pg 350]</span><a name="Pg350" id="Pg350" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

last few years the City Chamberlain's accounts—touching
"the lands of Mr. John Carpenter, sometyme
commen clarke of this cittie"—have been brought
to light, and serve to supplement in a small way
Stow's meagre but valuable statement. The rental
or amount with which the Chamberlain charged
himself for the year 1565 or 1566 is there set down
as £41 0<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">s.</span></span> 4<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d.</span></span>, and the discharge—embracing a quit
rent due to the Dean and Chapter of Westminster,
and expenses incurred in overseeing, clothing and
feeding four poor children "being founde at scoole
and lerning by the bequeste of the sayde Master
Carpenter"—amounted to £19 12<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">s.</span></span> 8<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d.</span></span>, leaving a

a beginning arose the school which, situate on the
Thames Embankment, now numbers over 700 scholars.</p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">St. Paul's School.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was a school attached to St. Paul's long
before Colet's day, just as there is one now, independent
of the school of Colet's foundation, and devoted
mainly to the instruction of the Cathedral choristers.
Soon after Colet's appointment to the Deanery in
1505 he experienced no little dissatisfaction with
the Cathedral School, where great laxity prevailed,
more especially in the religious education of the
"children of Paul's," and so, about the year 1509—the
year of Henry's accession—having recently come
into a considerable estate by the death of his father,
he set about acquiring a small property situate at the
east end of St. Paul's Church for the purpose of
establishing another school which would better realise<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page351">[pg 351]</span><a name="Pg351" id="Pg351" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc195" id="toc195"></a>
his own ideal of what a school should be than the
existing Cathedral School. Colet's School grew apace.
In 1511 he was in negotiation with the Court of
Aldermen for the purchase "of a certen grounde of
the citie for an entre to be hadde into his new
gramer scole."<a id="noteref_1046" name="noteref_1046" href="#note_1046"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1046</span></span></a> By January of the next year (1512)
he had succeeded in obtaining the assent both of the
Court of Aldermen and Common Council to the
purchase by him of a "certen grounde in the Olde
Chaunge for the inlargyng of his gramer scole in
Powly's Churcheyerd" for the sum of £30.<a id="noteref_1047" name="noteref_1047" href="#note_1047"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1047</span></span></a> The
property was conveyed to him by deed, dated the
27th September, which deed was sealed with the
common seal on the 7th October following.<a id="noteref_1048" name="noteref_1048" href="#note_1048"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1048</span></span></a> The
question as to whom he should entrust the management
of his school caused Colet no little anxiety.
He eventually decided to confide its revenues and
management entirely to the Mercers' Company, and
when asked the reason for his so doing replied that
"though there was nothing certain in human affairs
he yet found the least corruption in them."<a id="noteref_1049" name="noteref_1049" href="#note_1049"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1049</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Considerable rivalry existed among the various
grammar schools of the city, more especially between
the boys of Colet's School and the boys of the more
ancient foundation of St. Antony, which, for a long
time, had the reputation for turning out the best
scholars. Public disputations were held in the open
air. The St. Paul's boys meeting St. Antony's boys
would derisively call them St. Antony's pigs, that
saint being generally represented with a pig following<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page352">[pg 352]</span><a name="Pg352" id="Pg352" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
him, and challenge them to a disputation; the latter
would retaliate by styling their rivals "pigeons of
St. Paul's," from the bird which then, as now, frequented
St. Paul's Churchyard. From questions of
grammar, writes Stow,<a id="noteref_1050" name="noteref_1050" href="#note_1050"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1050</span></span></a> they usually fell to blows
"with their satchels full of books, many times in
great heaps, that they troubled the streets and
passengers." After the decay of St. Antony's School
the rivalry was taken up, but in a more friendly way,
by the later foundation of the Merchant Taylors'
School.</p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">Provincial grammar schools founded by citizens of London.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the citizens of London did not limit their
efforts in the cause of education to their own city.
Throughout the country there are to be found
grammar schools which owe their establishment to
the liberal-mindedness and open-handed generosity of
the city merchant.<a id="noteref_1051" name="noteref_1051" href="#note_1051"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1051</span></span></a> Their existence bears testimony
to the kindly feeling which men who had grown rich
in London still bore to the provincial town or village
which gave them birth and which they had left in
early life to seek their fortune in the great metropolis.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To take but a few instances: Sir John Percival,
a merchant-tailor, who in 1487 filled the subordinate
office of Lord Mayor's carver, performing his duties
so well that the mayor, Sir Henry Colet, nominated
him one of the sheriffs for the year ensuing by the
time honoured custom of drinking to him at a public
dinner, founded a school at Macclesfield. Stephen<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page353">[pg 353]</span><a name="Pg353" id="Pg353" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc196" id="toc196"></a>
Jenyns, another merchant-tailor, did the same thing at
Wolverhampton. Sir Thomas White, another member
of the same company, founded two schools in the
provinces, one at Reading and another at Bristol,
besides the College of St. John at Oxford. Sir
William Harper, yet another merchant-tailor, established
a school at Bedford.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Mercers' Company rivalled the Merchant-Taylors'
in the number of schools established in the
country through the liberality of its members. Sir
John Gresham founded one at Holt, in Norfolk; Sir
Rowland Hill, an ancestor of the originator of the
Penny Postal scheme, another at Drayton, in Shropshire;
whilst schools at Horsham, in Sussex, and
West Lavington, in Wiltshire, were erected by two
other mercers, Richard Collier and William Dauntsey.
There exist at the present day at least four schools
which owe their foundation to wealthy members of
the Grocers' Company, the well known school at
Oundle, co. Northampton, upon which the Company
have expended on capital account the sum of
£35,000, having been founded by Sir William Laxton;
another at Sevenoaks, in Kent, by William Sevenoke,
a native of the place, who rose from very humble
circumstances to the chief magistracy of the city;
another at Witney, in Oxfordshire, by Henry Box,
and another at Colwall, co. Hereford, by Humphry
Walwyn. Sir Andrew Judd, a member of the Skinners'
Company, established a school at Tonbridge, whilst
Sir Wolstan Dixie, another skinner, performed the
same charitable act at Market Bosworth. Lastly,
Sir George Monoux and Thomas Russell, both of
them members of the Drapers' Company, founded<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page354">[pg 354]</span><a name="Pg354" id="Pg354" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
schools at Walthamstow and at Barton-under-Needwood,
co. Stafford, respectively.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the Feast of St. Matthew (21 Sept.), 1515, a
messenger arrived in the city from Wolsey desiring
the mayor and aldermen to attend that evening at
St. Paul's to return thanks to Almighty God for the
queen, who was quick with child. The summons was
obeyed,<a id="noteref_1052" name="noteref_1052" href="#note_1052"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1052</span></span></a> and in the following February (1516) the
Princess Mary was born.</p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">The city and Cardinal Wolsey, 1516.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By this time Wolsey had risen to be a great
power in the State. In 1514 he had been made
Archbishop of York, and in the following year a
cardinal. His high position as a prince of the Church,
as well as his authority with the king, rendered it
desirable for the citizens to keep well with him. On
the 6th March, 1516, it was resolved to send a deputation
to the cardinal for the purpose of securing his
favour. No expense was to be spared in the matter,
and all costs and charges were to be paid by the
Chamber.<a id="noteref_1053" name="noteref_1053" href="#note_1053"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1053</span></span></a> In the following June the cardinal handed
to the mayor a list of abuses in the city which required
reform. Sedition was rife there; the commons were
disobedient, the statute of apparel was ignored, vagabonds
and masterless folk resorted there and unlawful
games were allowed in houses. The king's council
required an answer on these points within a few days,
and an answer was accordingly given, but the purport
of it is not recorded, although it was read to the
Court of Aldermen before being despatched.<a id="noteref_1054" name="noteref_1054" href="#note_1054"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1054</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In November of the same year (1516) the City
was in difficulties with the recently erected Court of<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page355">[pg 355]</span><a name="Pg355" id="Pg355" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc197" id="toc197"></a>
Star Chamber, and Wolsey, who practically kept the
whole business of government in his own hands, came
to the City's assistance with advice. It appears that
a subsidy was due on the 21st of this month and the
City had not paid its quota. The mayor and aldermen
were cited to appear before the cardinal and other lords
of the council in the Star Chamber at Westminster.
Being asked if they had "sworne for their assayng,"
to the king's subsidy, the Recorder answered on their
behalf that such procedure was contrary to Act of
Parliament. The cardinal thereupon advised them to
agree to give the king £2,000 in order to be discharged
of their oaths "or ells every of theym to be sworn of
and uppon the true value of their substance within
the sum of 100 marks." This took place on Saturday,
the 22nd, and the mayor and aldermen were to give
an answer to the Star Chamber by the following
Wednesday. On Tuesday, the 25th, the Court of
Aldermen met to consider what was best to be done
under the circumstances. The decision they arrived
at was that as the present assessment was less than
the last, they would, in consideration of the king's
letters, make up the sum then payable so that it
should equal the last assessment.<a id="noteref_1055" name="noteref_1055" href="#note_1055"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1055</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The seditious "brutes" or riots of which Wolsey
had complained as daily occurring in the city were
soon to assume a serious form. They were occasioned
for the most part by the jealousy with which everybody
who was not a freeman of the city was looked
upon by the free citizen. The influx of strangers and
foreigners has been daily increasing, notwithstanding
the limitations and restrictions placed upon their<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page356">[pg 356]</span><a name="Pg356" id="Pg356" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
residence and mode of trading,<a id="noteref_1056" name="noteref_1056" href="#note_1056"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1056</span></span></a> whilst the tendency

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whilst the civic authorities were doing all they
could to prevent the possibility of a disturbance
arising on the coming May-day<a id="noteref_1058" name="noteref_1058" href="#note_1058"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1058</span></span></a>—a day kept as a
general holiday in the city—occasion was taken by
a minister of the church, whose duty it was to preach
the usual Spital sermon on Easter Tuesday (14 April),
to incite the freemen to rise up against the foreigner
and stranger.<a id="noteref_1059" name="noteref_1059" href="#note_1059"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1059</span></span></a> When the 1st May arrived all might
have been well, had not a city alderman allowed his
zeal to outrun his discretion. It happened that John
Mundy,<a id="noteref_1060" name="noteref_1060" href="#note_1060"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1060</span></span></a> Alderman of Queenhithe Ward, came across
some youngsters playing "at the bucklers" at a time
when by a recent order they should have been within
doors, and he commanded them to desist. This they
showed no disposition to do, and when force was
threatened raised the cry for 'prentices and clubs. A
large crowd quickly assembled and the alderman had
to beat a hasty retreat. The mob, now thoroughly
roused, proceeded to set free the prisoners in Newgate
and the compters, and to attack the strangers and<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page357">[pg 357]</span><a name="Pg357" id="Pg357" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc198" id="toc198"></a>

Rioting continued throughout the night, but early the
following morning they were met by a large force which
the mayor in the meantime had collected, and 300 of
them were made prisoners, so that by the time that
assistance arrived from the court quiet had been
restored. A commission of Oyer and Terminer was
opened at the Guildhall to try the offenders. John
Lincoln, who had not so long ago been appointed
surveyor of goods bought and sold by foreigners,<a id="noteref_1062" name="noteref_1062" href="#note_1062"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1062</span></span></a> was
charged with being the instigator of the riot, and being
found guilty was hanged in Cheapside, whilst twelve
others were hanged on gallows in different parts of
the city. Others received the king's pardon with
halters round their necks in token of the fate they
deserved.<a id="noteref_1063" name="noteref_1063" href="#note_1063"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1063</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The civic authorities were not unnaturally anxious
to make their peace with the king, and to disclaim
any complicity in the late outbreak. The Court of
Aldermen met on the 11th May to consider how
best to approach his majesty on so delicate a subject.
It was decided to send a deputation to the lord
cardinal to "feel his mind" as to the number of
persons that should appear before the king. The
next day eight aldermen and the Recorder were
nominated by the court "to go the Kinges grace and
to knowe his plesure when the Mayr and Aldremen<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page358">[pg 358]</span><a name="Pg358" id="Pg358" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The deputation forthwith proceeded, clothed in
gowns of black, to Greenwich, whither the king had
gone on the 11th May. The Recorder as usual acted
as spokesman, and humbly prayed the royal forgiveness
for the negligence displayed by the mayor in not
keeping the king's peace within the city. The king
in reply told them plainly his opinion that the civic
authorities had winked at the whole business, and
referred them to Cardinal Wolsey, his chancellor,
who would declare to them his pleasure.<a id="noteref_1065" name="noteref_1065" href="#note_1065"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1065</span></span></a> With
this answer the deputation withdrew and reported
what had taken place to the mayor, who had wisely
kept away. It was clear that above all things the
favour of the cardinal had to be obtained. For this
purpose a committee was appointed, whose duty it
was to "devise what thinges of plesur shalbe geven
to my lord Cardynall and to other of the lordes as

22nd May matters had evidently been accommodated.
On that date the king sat at Westminster Hall in
great state, surrounded by the lords of his council and
attended by the cardinal. The mayor and aldermen
and chief commoners of the city, chosen from the
leading civic companies,<a id="noteref_1067" name="noteref_1067" href="#note_1067"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1067</span></span></a> had arrived by nine o'clock

knew the king's weakness for theatrical display. At
Henry's command all the prisoners were brought
into his presence. They appeared, to the number of
400 men and eleven women, all with ropes round
their necks. After the cardinal had administered a
rebuke to the civic authorities for their negligence,
and had declared that the prisoners had deserved
death, a formal pardon was proclaimed by the king,
the cardinal exhorting all present to loyalty and
obedience. It was some time before the effects of
the late outbreak disappeared. Compensation for
losses had to be made;<a id="noteref_1069" name="noteref_1069" href="#note_1069"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1069</span></span></a> some were bound over to

the citizens and merchant strangers for submission
to the king.<a id="noteref_1071" name="noteref_1071" href="#note_1071"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1071</span></span></a> In September there were

were better prepared than formerly, and effectually
stopt any such attempt by putting suspected persons
into prison.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lest any unfavourable report should reach the
cardinal, the Recorder and another were ordered to
ride in all haste to Sion, where Wolsey was thought to

to Windsor and to report to him the active measures

more violently than ever, accompanied by measles
and small-pox. The king ordered all inhabitants of
infected houses to keep indoors and hang out wisps
of straw, and when compelled to walk abroad to carry
white rods.<a id="noteref_1076" name="noteref_1076" href="#note_1076"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1076</span></span></a> This order, however, was badly received
in the city and gave rise to much murmuring and
dissatisfaction.<a id="noteref_1077" name="noteref_1077" href="#note_1077"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1077</span></span></a> The civic authorities did what they
could to mitigate the evil by driving out beggars
and vagabonds, and removing slaughter-houses outside
the city walls,<a id="noteref_1078" name="noteref_1078" href="#note_1078"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1078</span></span></a> as well as by administering relief to the
poorer classes by the distribution of tokens or licences<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page361">[pg 361]</span><a name="Pg361" id="Pg361" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc200" id="toc200"></a>
to solicit alms. These tokens consisted of round
"beedes" of white tin, bearing the City's arms in
the centre, to be worn on the right shoulder.<a id="noteref_1079" name="noteref_1079" href="#note_1079"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1079</span></span></a> In
the midst of so much real suffering, there were
not wanting those who took advantage of the charitable
feeling which the crisis called forth and were not
ashamed to gain a livelihood by simulating illness.
Such a one was Miles Rose, who on the 11th March,
1518, openly confessed before the Court of Aldermen
that he had frequently dissembled the sickness of
the "fallyng evyle" (or epilepsy) in divers parish
churches in the city, on which occasions "jemewes"
of silver, called cramp rings, would as often as not
be placed on his fingers by charitable passers-by, with
which he would quickly make off, pocketing at the
same time many a twopence which had been bestowed
upon him.<a id="noteref_1080" name="noteref_1080" href="#note_1080"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1080</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The city could scarcely have recovered its wonted
appearance after the ravages of the pestilence before
its streets were enlivened with one of those magnificent
displays for which London became justly famous,
the occasion being an embassy from the French king
sent to negotiate a marriage treaty between Henry's
daughter Mary, a child but two years of age, and
the still younger Dauphin of France. The City
Records, strange to say, appear to be altogether
silent on this subject, and yet the embassy, for
magnificent display, was such as had never been seen
within its walls before. We can understand that the
embassy was not acceptable to the thrifty middle-class
trading burgess, when we read that it was accompanied<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page362">[pg 362]</span><a name="Pg362" id="Pg362" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
by a swarm of pedlars and petty hucksters who
showed an unbecoming anxiety to do business in
hats, caps and other merchandise, which under colour
of the embassy had been smuggled into the country
duty free.<a id="noteref_1081" name="noteref_1081" href="#note_1081"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1081</span></span></a> The foreign retail trader was at the best of
times an abomination to the free burgess, and this sharp
practice on the part of the Frenchmen, coming so soon
after the recent outburst against strangers on Evil
May-day, only served to accentuate his animosity—"At
this dooing mannie an Englishman grudged, but
it availed not."<a id="noteref_1082" name="noteref_1082" href="#note_1082"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1082</span></span></a> The ambassadors were lodged at
the Merchant Taylors' Hall, which, owing to the
ill-timed action of the French pedlars, had the look of
a mart. On Sunday, the 3rd October, the king, with
a train of 1,000 mounted gentlemen richly dressed,
attended by the legates and foreign ambassadors, went
in procession to St. Paul's to hear mass; after which
the king took his oath—a ceremonial which the French
admiral declared to be "too magnificent for description."
On the following Tuesday (5 Oct.) the marriage
ceremony—so far as it could be carried out
between such infants—was celebrated at Greenwich,
and a tiny gold ring, in which was a valuable diamond,
placed upon Mary's finger.<a id="noteref_1083" name="noteref_1083" href="#note_1083"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1083</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the following year (July, 1519) the streets
witnessed another scene of gaiety. This time it was
a visit of the legate, Cardinal Campeggio, for which
the civic authorities made great preparations.<a id="noteref_1084" name="noteref_1084" href="#note_1084"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1084</span></span></a> In<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page363">[pg 363]</span><a name="Pg363" id="Pg363" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc201" id="toc201"></a>

and cloaks of scarlet, were ordered to take up their
position at 9 o'clock on the morning of Relic Sunday
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the third Sunday after Midsummer Day) at St.

were to stand the Skinners, then the Mercers and
other worshipful crafts in their order, clothed in their
last and best livery. In this manner the street was
to be lined on either side from the west door of St.
Paul's down to Baynard's Castle. Upon the arrival
of the lord cardinal and other lords at the Cathedral
the mayor and aldermen were to head the procession
and seat themselves in the choir to hear <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Te Deum</span></span>
sung. Bonfires or "pryncypall fyres" were to be
lighted at St. Magnus corner, Gracechurch, Leadenhall,
the conduit on Cornhill, St. Thomas "of Acres,"
the Standard and little conduit in Cheap, the Standard
in Fleet Street, and in Bishopsgate Street; whilst
cresset lights and small fires "made after the manner
of Midsummer-night" were to add to the gaiety of the
scene. Men-at-arms, well harnessed and apparelled,
were to keep certain streets, whilst the aldermen and
their constables were to keep watch and ward in their
best array of harness. The ambassadors, who were to
be lodged in Cornhill, were to be escorted home at night
by the aldermen with torches, and to await their commands.
There was one other, perhaps not unnecessary,
direction to be followed, which was to the effect that
if by any chance the strangers should be overcome
by the hospitality of the city, or, in the words of the
record—"yf eny oversyght be w<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">t</span></span> moche drynke of

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The legate landed at Deal on the 23rd July, and
by slow stages was conducted with every mark of
respect to London. His passage through the city
was associated with an episode of a decidedly comic
character if we are to believe the chronicler. A story
is told<a id="noteref_1085" name="noteref_1085" href="#note_1085"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1085</span></span></a> that the night before Campeggio entered
London, Wolsey sent him twelve mules with (empty)
coffers, in order to give a semblance of wealth to the
legate and his retinue. In Cheapside one of the mules
turned restive and upset the chests, out of which
tumbled old hose, shoes, bread, meat, and eggs, with
"muche vile baggage," at which the street boys cried
"See, see my lord legate's treasure!" The story,
however, is on good authority deemed more malicious
than probable.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In January, 1519, the Emperor Maximilian died
and left the imperial crown to be contested for by the
kings of France and Spain. It eventually fell to the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Both France and Germany were eager to secure
the co-operation of Henry. Charles anticipated the
meeting which was to take place between Henry and
Francis on the famous Field of the Cloth of Gold by
coming over in person to England (May, 1519) and
having a private conference with his uncle. The
young emperor did not visit the city on this occasion;
but in 1522, when war had broken out between him
and Francis and he was again in England, he was<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page365">[pg 365]</span><a name="Pg365" id="Pg365" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc202" id="toc202"></a>
escorted to the city with great honour and handsomely
lodged in the palace of Bridewell. Nearly £1,000
was raised to meet the expenses of his reception and
of furnishing a body of 100 bowmen for the king's

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Between the first and second visits of the emperor
the citizens had witnessed some strange sights and
had gone through much suffering and privation. The
city had scarcely ever been free from sickness, and
famine and pestilence had followed one another in
quick succession. In September, 1520, the fellowships
or civic companies subscribed over £1,000 for
the purchase of wheat<a id="noteref_1092" name="noteref_1092" href="#note_1092"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1092</span></span></a> to be stored at the Bridgehouse,

that every house attacked was ordered to be marked

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again a scarcity of corn was feared, and the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The citizens had also in the meanwhile witnessed
the arrest and execution of the Duke of Buckingham,
son of the duke who figured so prominently before the
citizens when the crown was offered to Richard III
at Baynard Castle. He was seized one day whilst
landing from his barge at the Hay Wharf, on a
number of charges all more or less frivolous. His
attendants were dismissed to the duke's "Manor of
the Rose," in the parish of St. Laurence Pountney<a id="noteref_1099" name="noteref_1099" href="#note_1099"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1099</span></span></a>—on
the site of which recently stood Merchant Taylors'
School—whilst he himself was conducted to the Tower
(16 April, 1521).  An indictment was laid against<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page367">[pg 367]</span><a name="Pg367" id="Pg367" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc203" id="toc203"></a>
him at the Guildhall before Sir John Brugge, lord
mayor, and others (8 May). After a trial at Westminster
which lasted some days, he was found guilty
of high treason, and condemned to be hanged, drawn
and quartered, and to suffer such other atrocities as
usually accompanied the death of a traitor in those
days. The king, however, satisfied with his condemnation,
spared him these indignities, and the duke
was allowed to meet his death at the block. His
corpse was reverently carried from the Tower to the
Church of the Austin Friars by six poor members of
that Order.<a id="noteref_1100" name="noteref_1100" href="#note_1100"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1100</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The duke had other friends in the city besides
these poor religious men, who thus requited in the only
way they could many acts of kindness done to their
Order by Buckingham in his life time, and his death
gave rise to much disaffection and seditious language
for some time afterwards.<a id="noteref_1101" name="noteref_1101" href="#note_1101"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1101</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The question arose whether the aldermen should

contribute the sum of £3,000,<a id="noteref_1104" name="noteref_1104" href="#note_1104"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1104</span></span></a> but this offer the
Common Council "nothyng regarded," but sent the

After long consultation the mayor and aldermen sent

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime a hasty valuation had been made
by the command of Wolsey of the plate of the livery
companies, and of the ready money lying in their
halls, the whole value of which was estimated to be
£4,000. This, together with the sum of £10,000
which the Court of Aldermen purposed raising among
the wealthier class of citizens, was all that the cardinal
was given to expect from the City.<a id="noteref_1106" name="noteref_1106" href="#note_1106"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1106</span></span></a> On the 24th
May the deputation, which had ridden with all speed
after the cardinal in order to make this report, returned
to the city and reported to the Court of Aldermen
that his grace was in no wise satisfied with the City's
offer, and that he expected the City to furnish the king
with at least £30,000, of which £10,000 was to be
ready within three days.<a id="noteref_1107" name="noteref_1107" href="#note_1107"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1107</span></span></a> The matter was compromised
by the City consenting to advance £20,000.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In June the Recorder had an interview with Wolsey
respecting the security to be given for repayment<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page369">[pg 369]</span><a name="Pg369" id="Pg369" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc204" id="toc204"></a>
of the loan. The cardinal refused to allow that
certain abbots, abbesses and priors, who had been
named, should enter into bond, and the citizens were
obliged to be content with the personal securities of
the king and Wolsey himself. Touching the plate of
the halls, the cardinal wished only to take it in case
of absolute necessity, and then only at a fair price.
He desired the owners to bring it to the Tower, "there
to be coyned and they [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>, the government] to pay
the seyd money that so shalbe coyned." The result
of the Recorder's interview was reported to the Court

a further advance of 4,000 marks. Their liberality
was repaid by a gracious letter from Wolsey himself,
in which he promised to see the money repaid in a

vexed the citizens more than anything was being
compelled to make oath before the cardinal's deputy

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was only one course left open to Henry,
and that was to summon a parliament. For nearly
eight years no parliament had sat. It was now
summoned to meet on the 15th April, 1523, not at
Westminster, but at the house of the Blackfriars.<a id="noteref_1115" name="noteref_1115" href="#note_1115"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1115</span></span></a>
The names of the city's representatives are on record.
The aldermen elected one of their body, George
Monoux, and with him was associated "according
to ancient customs," the city's Recorder, William
Shelley; whilst the commons elected John Hewster,
a mercer, and William Roche, a draper<a id="noteref_1116" name="noteref_1116" href="#note_1116"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1116</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A few days after the election a committee of

chosen Speaker. The enormous sum of £800,000
was demanded. Expecting some hesitation on the
part of the Commons, Wolsey himself determined to
argue with them, and suddenly made his appearance
in state. Finding that his speech was received in grim
silence, he turned to More for a reply. The Speaker,
falling on his knees, declared his inability to make
any answer until he had received the instructions of
the House, and intimated that perhaps the silence of
the Commons was due to the cardinal's presence.
Wolsey accordingly departed discomforted.<a id="noteref_1118" name="noteref_1118" href="#note_1118"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1118</span></span></a> His

however, and rendered it several small services.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Emboldened by their recent success the citizens
determined to make a stand against other exactions,
and when in May, 1523, another demand was made
for one hundred bowmen, as in the previous year,
they sent their charter to the cardinal and begged
that the article touching citizens not being liable to
foreign service might remain in force. A similar

again the assistance of Wolsey was called in.<a id="noteref_1119" name="noteref_1119" href="#note_1119"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1119</span></span></a> The

was threatened with danger nearer home. The Scots

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The news of the defeat and capture of the
French king at Pavia (24 Feb., 1525) was hailed by
Henry with great delight. The crown of France was
now, he thought, within his grasp. On Saturday, the
11th March, a triumph was made in the city to
celebrate "the takynge of the Frenche kyng in
Bataill by Themporer and his alies."<a id="noteref_1129" name="noteref_1129" href="#note_1129"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1129</span></span></a> Bonfires
were lighted at different places, one being in Saint
Paul's Churchyard near the house where lay the
foreign ambassadors. The Chamberlain was ordered
to provide a hogshead of wine at every fire. The
city minstrels filled the air with music, and the parish
clerks attended with their singing children, who sat
about the bonfires and sang ballads and "other
delectable and joyfull songs." On the Sunday
following the king and queen and officers of state
attended a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Te Deum</span></span> at St. Paul's, the legate himself
pronouncing the benediction.<a id="noteref_1130" name="noteref_1130" href="#note_1130"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1130</span></span></a></p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">The Amicable Loan, 1525.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Henry's first impulse was to take advantage of
the French king's misfortune; the cardinal, on the
other hand, saw danger in the predominating influence
of Charles in Europe, and would gladly have seen his
master join hands with Francis against the emperor.
He was nevertheless bound to carry out the king's
wishes as if they were his own, and money was
necessary for the purpose. Instead of resorting to
a benevolence—a mode of raising money already
declared by parliament to be illegal—he suggested
that the people should be asked for what was called
an Amicable Loan, on the old feudal ground that
the king was about to lead an expedition in person.<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page375">[pg 375]</span><a name="Pg375" id="Pg375" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc208" id="toc208"></a>
The citizens were among the first to whom Wolsey
made application. Were they of opinion, he asked,
that the king should undertake the expedition to
France in person? If so, he could not go otherwise
than beseemed a prince, and this he could not do
without the city's aid. The sum they were asked to
subscribe did not, he said, amount to half their substance,
which the king might very well have demanded.
When it was objected that trade had been bad,
Wolsey lost his temper and declared that it was
better that some citizens should suffer rather than
that the king should be in want, and that if they
refused to pay it might "fortune to cost some their
heddes."<a id="noteref_1131" name="noteref_1131" href="#note_1131"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1131</span></span></a> At length the citizens agreed to grant
the king a sixth part of their substance, which Henry
graciously acknowledged by letter (25 April),<a id="noteref_1132" name="noteref_1132" href="#note_1132"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1132</span></span></a> saying
that it was not his wish to overburden them, for he
valued their prosperity more than ten such realms as
France. The letter was read, by Wolsey's express
wish, to the Common Council on the 28th, when it
was agreed to ask for a fortnight's grace before
sending an answer to so important a missive.<a id="noteref_1133" name="noteref_1133" href="#note_1133"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1133</span></span></a> A
deputation was forthwith despatched to Hampton
Court to solicit the cardinal's mediation, but not
being able to obtain an interview they returned, and
steps were taken to raise the money required.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the cardinal was informed later on that
the alderman of each ward was holding an enquiry as
to the means of the inhabitants he affected to be very
angry. "They had no right to examine anyone," he
said; "I am your commissioner, I will examine you<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page376">[pg 376]</span><a name="Pg376" id="Pg376" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
one by one myself." The mayor (Sir William
Bailey) thereupon threw himself at the cardinal's feet
beseeching him that since it was by Act of Common
Council that the aldermen had sat in their respective
wards for the purpose of taking the benevolence—a
procedure which he now perceived to be against the
law—the Act should by the Common Council be revoked.
"Well," said Wolsey "I am content," and he
then proceeded to ask how much the mayor and
aldermen then present were prepared to give. When
the mayor incautiously remarked that if he made any
promise there and then it might perhaps cost him his
life, Wolsey again became furious. What! the mayor's
life threatened for obeying the king's orders! He
would see to that.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the country the loan met with so much
opposition that a rebellion was feared. At length,
finding it was impossible to collect the money, Wolsey
sent (19 May) for the mayor and aldermen and
informed them that the king had given up all
thoughts of his expedition to France, and that they
were pardoned of all that had been demanded of
them.<a id="noteref_1134" name="noteref_1134" href="#note_1134"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1134</span></span></a></p>

the drawing up of articles for a permanent
peace. By September all was settled, and Wolsey
returned to England. Ambassadors from France
shortly afterwards arrived, and were lodged in the
Bishop of London's palace in St. Paul's Churchyard.

as alderman of the Ward of Farringdon Within,
in 1527, again brought Henry and the citizens into
variance. The king desired Wythypol's discharge, at
least for a time. The Court of Aldermen hesitated
to accede to the request and consulted Wolsey.<a id="noteref_1138" name="noteref_1138" href="#note_1138"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1138</span></span></a> He
recommended them an interview with the king at
Greenwich. To Greenwich they accordingly went
(24 Feb.) by water, where they arrived in time to
give a formal reception to the cardinal, who landed
soon afterwards from his barge. After a few words
had passed between the cardinal and the municipal
officers, the former entered the palace, whilst the
latter waited in the king's great chamber till dinner
time. When that hour arrived they were bidden to go
down to the hall, where the mayor was entertained<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page378">[pg 378]</span><a name="Pg378" id="Pg378" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
at the lord steward's mess, and the aldermen received
like attention from the comptroller and other officers
of state. The city's Counsel who had accompanied
the mayor and aldermen were entertained at the
table of "master coferer." Dinner over, the company
returned to the great chamber, where they
were kept waiting till the evening. At length the
mayor and aldermen were bidden to the king's
presence in his secret chamber. What took place
there the writer of the record declares himself unable
to say,<a id="noteref_1139" name="noteref_1139" href="#note_1139"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1139</span></span></a> and, although the mayor afterwards made a
report of the matter to the court, no particulars are
recorded in the City's archives. The practical outcome
of the interview appears to have been that
Wythypol was left unmolested for a whole twelve-month.
When that time had elapsed he was again
summoned before the Court of Aldermen either to
accept office or take the oath prescribed.<a id="noteref_1140" name="noteref_1140" href="#note_1140"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1140</span></span></a> Refusing

This took place on the 6th February, 1528. On the
3rd March he appeared in person before the Court of
Aldermen and desired a respite from office, or to be
allowed to pay a fine. Being asked the amount of
fine he was prepared to pay, he offered £40, and at
the same time asked to be discharged from office for
a period of three years. This offer was declined,
and Wythypol was again ordered to take the oath
prescribed for his discharge.<a id="noteref_1142" name="noteref_1142" href="#note_1142"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1142</span></span></a> Nearly three months
were allowed to elapse before any further steps
were taken, when, on the 22nd May, the court<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page379">[pg 379]</span><a name="Pg379" id="Pg379" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc210" id="toc210"></a>
again ordered Wythypol to appear at its next
meeting, and to take up office, or else take the
oath, or pay such fine as should be assessed by the
mayor, aldermen and common council.<a id="noteref_1143" name="noteref_1143" href="#note_1143"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1143</span></span></a> It is
certain that he did not take office, so the conclusion
must be that he availed himself of one or other of
the alternatives open to him. John Brown was
elected alderman of Farringdon Within shortly afterwards,
but he was discharged by the Common
Council, and the aldermanry was subsequently filled
by John Hardy being translated to it from Aldersgate

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For some years past Henry had been meditating
a divorce from Catherine of Aragon, his brother's
widow, but it was not until 1529 that the assent of
the Pope was at last obtained to try the validity of
the marriage. The legatine court sat in the city at<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page380">[pg 380]</span><a name="Pg380" id="Pg380" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the house of the Blackfriars, where every arrangement
was made to add dignity to the proceedings. At its
head sat the two cardinals, Campeggio and Wolsey,
on chairs covered with cloth of gold, and on their
right sat Henry himself.<a id="noteref_1147" name="noteref_1147" href="#note_1147"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1147</span></span></a> The sudden suspension of
all proceedings after the court had sat for some weeks,
and the revocation of the cause to the Court of Rome,
led to Wolsey's downfall. In October the seals were
taken from him and given to Sir Thomas More, his
furniture and plate were seized, and he himself ordered
to remove from London.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A few days after Wolsey's disgrace a banquet
was held at the Guildhall on the occasion of the
swearing in of Ralph Dodmer, the newly-elected
mayor. It is the first lord mayor's banquet of which
any particulars have come down to us, and they are
interesting as recording the names of the chief guests.
The mayor's court, the scene of the feast, was
boarded and hung with cloth of Arras for the occasion.
One table was set apart for peers of the realm, at the
head of which sat the new lord chancellor and at the
bottom the lords Berkeley and Powis. At either side of
the table sat nine peers, among whom were the dukes
of Norfolk and Suffolk, the one being the treasurer and
the other the marshal of England, Sir Thomas Grey,
Marquis of Dorset, the Earl of Oxford, high chamberlain,
and the Earl of Shrewsbury, lord steward of
England, Tunstal, Bishop of London, Sir Thomas
Boleyn, Lord Rochford, whose daughter Anne was
shortly to experience the peril of sharing Henry's

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was not long before further proceedings were
taken against the king's late minister. On the 3rd
November (1529), after the lapse of six years, parliament
met in the city at the palace of Bridewell.
The City was represented by Thomas Seymer, an
alderman and ex-mayor, John Baker, the City's Recorder,
John Petyte, grocer, and Paul Wythypol,<a id="noteref_1149" name="noteref_1149" href="#note_1149"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1149</span></span></a> the
merchant-tailor whose election as alderman had recently
created no little trouble. Among other members
was Thomas Cromwell,<a id="noteref_1150" name="noteref_1150" href="#note_1150"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1150</span></span></a> a friend of Wolsey, and destined
soon to take his place as the king's chief adviser. A
bill for disabling the cardinal from being restored to
his former dignities was carried by the Lords and sent
down to the Commons (1 Dec.). There it is said to
have met with the strenuous opposition of Cromwell.
Of this, however, there is some doubt, as it is uncertain
whether the bill provoked any discussion, parliament
being shortly afterward prorogued (17 Dec.)
and the unhappy cardinal left in suspense as to what
fate was in store for him.<a id="noteref_1151" name="noteref_1151" href="#note_1151"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1151</span></span></a> At Christmas he fell ill,
and the king's heart became so far softened towards
his old favourite that early in the following year
(Feb., 1530) he was restored to the archbishopric of<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page382">[pg 382]</span><a name="Pg382" id="Pg382" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
York with all its possessions except York-place
(Whitehall) in Westminster, which Henry could not
bring himself to surrender. His colleges were seized;
the college he had founded at Ipswich was sold; but
his college at Oxford, known as Cardinal College, was
afterwards re-established under the name of Christ
Church. He himself was not allowed to rest long in
peace. He was summoned to London on a charge of
treason, for which there was little or no foundation,
but the troubles of the last two years had rendered
him so infirm that he died on the way.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Although Wolsey was no more, his works followed
him. He it was, and not Henry, who first conceived
the idea of church reform, towards which some steps
had been taken in Wolsey's lifetime. It was left for
Henry to carry out the design of his great minister.
When the king laid his hand on the monasteries, he
only followed the example set by the cardinal in 1525,
when some of the smaller religious houses in Kent,
Sussex and Essex were suppressed for his great foundation
of Oxford. To assist him in carrying out his design
he turned to parliament. Relieved as they now were
of the oppression of the great nobles, the Commons
were ready to use their newly-acquired independence
against the clergy, who exacted extravagant fees and misused
the powers of the ecclesiastical courts. Acts were
passed regulating the payment of mortuary fees and
the fees for probate, whilst another Act restricted the
holding of pluralities and the taking of ferms by church-men.<a id="noteref_1152" name="noteref_1152" href="#note_1152"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1152</span></span></a>

with pains and penalties as opposed to the royal
prerogative.<a id="noteref_1153" name="noteref_1153" href="#note_1153"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1153</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the city the question of tithes payable to the
clergy had been always more or less a vexed question.
Before the commencement of the thirteenth century
the city clergy had been supported by casual dues in<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page384">[pg 384]</span><a name="Pg384" id="Pg384" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
addition to their glebe land. These casual payments
were originally personal, but subsequently became
regulated by the amount of rent paid by parishioners
for their houses. A question arose as to whether the
citizens were also liable to pay personal tithes on
their gains, and it was eventually decided that they
were so liable.<a id="noteref_1154" name="noteref_1154" href="#note_1154"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1154</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 31st August, 1527, a committee, which
had been specially appointed to enquire into matters
concerning the city's welfare, reported, among other
things, upon the tithe question as it then stood in the
city.<a id="noteref_1155" name="noteref_1155" href="#note_1155"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1155</span></span></a> The "curates," they said, had purchased a
Bull of Pope Nicholas, on the 6th August, 1453, and
this Bull had been confirmed by Act of Common
Council on the 3rd March, 1475. Not only was the
amount of the tithe payable fixed by the Bull, but the
Bull itself was to be publicly read by the curates four
times a year, so that no doubt should exist in the minds
of the parishioners. This the curates had failed to do,
and had caused their parishioners heavy legal expenses
in disputing demands for tithes. One man was known
to have spent as much as £100 in his own defence.
The committee suggested that the whole question
should be referred to the Bishop of London, and that
a translation of the Bull should be exhibited in every
church. The citizens were the more aggrieved because
many parsonages and vicarages were let to ferm.<a id="noteref_1156" name="noteref_1156" href="#note_1156"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1156</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The curates made their defence in a book of
eighteen articles touching tithes and other oblations,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page385">[pg 385]</span><a name="Pg385" id="Pg385" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc215" id="toc215"></a>
the chief point being that every householder, time out
of mind, had been bound to pay to God and the
Church one farthing out of every 10<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">s.</span></span> of rent, a half-penny
out of 20<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">s.</span></span> and so forth, on 100 days of the
year; amounting in all to 2<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">s.</span></span> 1<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d.</span></span> for every 10<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">s.</span></span> rent
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">per annum</span></span>. This manner of payment proving tedious,
the curates and their parishioners came to an agreement
that 1<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">s.</span></span> 2<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d.</span></span> should be paid on every 6<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">s.</span></span> 8<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d.</span></span>
or noble, and this sum the curates had been receiving
time out of mind, none reclaiming or denying. But,
inasmuch as this payment by occupiers of houses was
only ordained for a "dowry" to the parish churches
of London which had no glebe lands, the curates
demanded that all merchants and artificers, with other
occupiers of the city, should pay personal tithes of
their "lucre or encrece" according to the common
law, and as "well conscyoned" men had been in the
habit of paying in times past.<a id="noteref_1157" name="noteref_1157" href="#note_1157"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1157</span></span></a> The book of articles
was laid before the Court of Common Council on
the 16th February, 1528, by Robert Carter and six
other priests, on behalf of their entire body. On
the following 16th March the Court of Aldermen
for themselves agreed to pay tithe at the forthcoming
Easter according to the Bull of Pope Nicholas, and
not after the rate of 1<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">s.</span></span> 2<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d.</span></span> on the noble,<a id="noteref_1158" name="noteref_1158" href="#note_1158"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1158</span></span></a> whilst
four days later the Common Council decided that,
for the sake of convenience, bills should be posted

the number of offering days (viz., eighty-two) and
the amount to be offered by inhabitants of the
city.<a id="noteref_1159" name="noteref_1159" href="#note_1159"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1159</span></span></a></p>

feel the heavy hand of the king and of his new

Spital, a house established by William Elsing, a
charitable mercer, for the relief of the blind, but
which had subsequently grown into a priory of
Augustinian canons of wealth and position, was confiscated
by the Crown. What became of the blind
inmates is not known. In the following year (1531)
the Priory of Holy Trinity, Aldgate, shared the same
fate. The priory had existed since the time of
Henry I and the "good queen" Matilda,<a id="noteref_1162" name="noteref_1162" href="#note_1162"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1162</span></span></a> and its

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Between 1531 and 1534 the City enjoyed some
respite from attack. It even recovered some of its
lost privileges. In 1521 Henry had deprived the
City of its right to the Great Beam, and of the issues
and profits derived from it, and had caused a conveyance
of it to be made to Sir William Sidney.
In 1531 the beam was re-conveyed to the City.<a id="noteref_1164" name="noteref_1164" href="#note_1164"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1164</span></span></a> The
Grocers' Company were scarcely less interested in
the beam than the City, for to them was deputed the

and sworn before the Court of Aldermen. Both the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Finding it hopeless to obtain the Pope's sanction
to his divorce from Catherine, Henry at last lost
all patience, and on the 25th January, 1533, was
privately married to Anne Boleyn. The match was
unpopular with the citizens, who took occasion of a
sermon preached on Easter-day to show their dissatisfaction.
According to Chapuys, the Spanish
ambassador, who sent an account of the affair to the
emperor, the greater part of the congregation got up
and left the church when prayers were desired for the
queen. When Henry heard of the insult thus offered
to his new bride he was furious, and forthwith sent
word to the mayor to see that no such manifestation
should occur again. Thereupon, continues Chapuys,
the mayor summoned the guilds to assemble in their
various halls and commanded them to cease murmuring
against the king's marriage on pain of
incurring the royal displeasure, and to order their
own journeymen and servants, "and, a still more
difficult task, their own wives," to refrain from
speaking disparagingly about the queen.<a id="noteref_1169" name="noteref_1169" href="#note_1169"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1169</span></span></a></p>

suitable reception as she passed from the Tower to
Westminster on the 31st May. The Court of Aldermen
directed (14 May) the wardens of the Haberdashers
to prepare their barge as well as the "bachelers"
barge for the occasion. Three pageants were to be

Standard was to run with wine. A deputation was

being Henry Gold, rector of the church of St. Mary
Aldermary, were executed at Tyburn for daring to
speak against the king's marriage.<a id="noteref_1176" name="noteref_1176" href="#note_1176"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1176</span></span></a> The friars proved

to submit.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The inmates of the London Charterhouse, who
might well have been left to enjoy their quiet seclusion
from the world, were startled by a visit from the king's
commissioners calling upon them to take the oath.
The manner of their reception by John Houghton,
the prior, and his brethren and subsequent proceedings
are graphically described by Maurice Chauncy,<a id="noteref_1177" name="noteref_1177" href="#note_1177"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1177</span></span></a> one<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page391">[pg 391]</span><a name="Pg391" id="Pg391" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc218" id="toc218"></a>
of the inmates, who was more compliant than his
brethren to the king's wishes, and thereby saved his
life. The prior and Humphrey Middlemore, the procurator
of the convent, were committed to the Tower
for counselling opposition to the commissioners. There
they were visited by the Archbishop of York and the
Bishop of London, who persuaded them at last that
the question of the succession was not a cause in
which to sacrifice their lives for conscience sake. The
result was that after a while Houghton and his companion
declared their willingness to submit. On the
29th May the commissioners received oaths of fealty
from Prior Houghton and five other monks, and on
the 6th June Bishop Lee and Sir Thomas Kitson,
one of the sheriffs, received similar oaths from a
number of priests, professed monks and lay brethren
or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">conversi</span></span> belonging to the house.<a id="noteref_1178" name="noteref_1178" href="#note_1178"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1178</span></span></a> The oaths of
obedience to the Act were given under reservation
"so far as the law of God permitted," and for a time
the monks were left in comparative quiet, some few
of them, of whom Cromwell entertained the most
hope of submission, being sent, by his direction, to
the convent of Sion.<a id="noteref_1179" name="noteref_1179" href="#note_1179"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1179</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The exhortations of the "father confessor" were
not without some measure of success, several of the
Carthusians being induced to alter their opinions as to
the king's demands. The seal of doom, however, was
fixed on the order by the passing of the Act which called
upon its members to renounce the Pope and acknowledge
the royal supremacy.<a id="noteref_1180" name="noteref_1180" href="#note_1180"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1180</span></span></a> Fisher and More denied
the king's title of Supreme Head of the Church, and
were committed to the Tower. At this crisis there
came to London two priors of Carthusian houses
established, one in Nottinghamshire and the other
in Lincolnshire. They came to talk over the
state of affairs with Houghton. An interview
with Cromwell, recently appointed vicar-general
or king's vicegerent in matters ecclesiastical, was
resolved on. The king might possibly be prevailed
upon to make some abatement in his demands.
Cromwell, however, no sooner discovered the object
of their visit than he committed them to the Tower
as rebels and would-be traitors. As they still refused
to acknowledge the king's supremacy in the Church,
in spite of all efforts of persuasion, they were brought
to trial, together with Father Reynolds of Sion, on a
charge of treason. A verdict of guilty was, after some
hesitation on the part of the jury, found against them,
and they were executed at Tyburn (4 May, 1535),
glorying in the cause for which they were held worthy
to suffer death. Houghton's arm was suspended over
the gateway of the London Charterhouse, in the fond
hope that the rest of the brethren might be awed
into submission. This atrocious act of barbarism had,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page393">[pg 393]</span><a name="Pg393" id="Pg393" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc219" id="toc219"></a>
however, precisely the opposite effect to that desired.
The monks were more resolute than ever not to
submit, and not even a personal visit of Henry himself
could turn them from their purpose.<a id="noteref_1181" name="noteref_1181" href="#note_1181"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1181</span></span></a> Three of
them were thereupon committed to prison, where
they were compelled to stand in an upright position
for thirteen days, chained from their necks to their arms
and with their legs fettered.<a id="noteref_1182" name="noteref_1182" href="#note_1182"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1182</span></span></a> They were afterwards
brought to trial on a charge of treason, convicted and
executed (19 June).</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fate of the remaining monks is soon told.
In May, 1537, the royal commissioners once more
attended at the Charterhouse, when they found
the majority of its inmates prepared to take the oath
prescribed. Ten of them, however, still refused, and
were committed to Newgate and there left to be
"dispatched by the hand of God," in other words to
meet a painful and lingering death from fever and
starvation. The following month the remnant of the
community made their submission, and the London
Charterhouse, as a monastic institution, ceased to
exist.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Fisher and More were now brought from the
Tower, where they had lain six months and more,
and convicted on a similar charge of treason. Their
sentence was commuted to death by beheading. Fisher
was the first to suffer (19 June, 1535). His head was
set up on London Bridge and his body buried in the
churchyard of All Hallows, Barking. More suffered
a few weeks later (6 July). His head, too, was placed
on London Bridge, but his body was buried in the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page394">[pg 394]</span><a name="Pg394" id="Pg394" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

monasteries—those of less than £200 a year—were
dissolved by Act of Parliament, and the inhabitants
of Lincolnshire and Yorkshire, taking fright lest the
king and Cromwell should proceed to despoil the
parish churches, set out on the Pilgrimage of Grace,
Henry sought the City's aid. On the 10th October a
letter from the king was read before the Court of
Aldermen, desiring them to dispatch forthwith to his
manor of Ampthill, where the nobles were about to
wait upon his majesty, a contingent of at least 250
armed men, 200 of which were to be well horsed, and

in Moorfields within twenty-four hours. The Mercers
were called upon to furnish the largest quota, viz.,
twenty men; the Grocers, Drapers, Tailors and Cloth-workers

child, to the king's bitter disappointment. Henry had
made up his mind to change his wives until he could
find one who would give him a male heir and thus
place the succession to the crown beyond all possibility
of doubt. The very next day following Anne
Boleyn's execution he married Jane Seymour. The
marriage necessitated the calling together of a
new parliament, when a fresh Act was passed settling<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page396">[pg 396]</span><a name="Pg396" id="Pg396" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the succession on Jane's children and declaring
both Mary and Elizabeth illegitimate. Nevertheless,
as soon as Mary made formal submission to her
father, the king's attitude towards her, from being
cold and cruel, changed at once to one of courtesy if
not of affection. He was thought to entertain the
idea of declaring her heir-apparent. Indeed, on
Sunday, the 20th August, she was actually proclaimed
as such in one of the London churches—no doubt by
some mistake.<a id="noteref_1192" name="noteref_1192" href="#note_1192"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1192</span></span></a></p>

The money, however, was not required, for the new

was seized by the king as an excuse for suppressing

his destructive policy in the city. Nevertheless, under
the immediate supervision of Cromwell, the work of
suppression went on, and before the end of 1538 was<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page398">[pg 398]</span><a name="Pg398" id="Pg398" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

concerns he showed as little regard for the rights
of others as in the affairs of State. He did not
scruple to remove bodily a small house, the property
of Stow's father, in order to enlarge his own garden,
giving neither warning beforehand nor explanation

seen, distributed among court favourites. The site of
the house and gardens of the Augustinian Friars in
Broad Street Ward was occupied, soon after their
suppression (12 Nov., 1538), by the mansion-house of
that politic courtier the celebrated Marquis of Winchester,
who managed to maintain himself in high
station in spite of the changes which took place
under the several reigns of Henry VIII, Edward VI,
Mary, and Elizabeth, "by being a willow and not an
oak." The building known at the present day as
Winchester House, in Broad Street, stands near the
site of the old mansion-house and garden of William
Paulet, first Marquis of Winchester. The Friars'
church he allowed to stand; and in June, 1550, the
nave was granted, by virtue of a charter permitting
alien non-conforming churches to exist in this country,
to the Dutch and Walloon churches.<a id="noteref_1203" name="noteref_1203" href="#note_1203"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1203</span></span></a> The first marquis

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The steeple of the church, which was of so great
beauty that the citizens desired its preservation,<a id="noteref_1206" name="noteref_1206" href="#note_1206"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1206</span></span></a> was
sold by the marquis to Henry Robinson, who forthwith
set to work to pull it down on the ground that
it was in such a state of decay as to be a danger to
the passer-by. Swinnerton, who happened to be
mayor at the time, ordered him to stay the work of
demolition; he, however, not only hurried on the
more, but obstructed the officers sent to put a stop to
the work, for which he was committed to Newgate to
stay there until he gave security for restoring what he had
already pulled down. The thought suggests itself that
the fact of Swinnerton having purchased adjacent property
may have made him the more zealous in preventing
the demolition of the steeple than perhaps he might
otherwise have been. However that may be, he lost
no time in informing the lords of the council of the
state of affairs and asking their advice (16 Feb.,
1612). The reply came three days later, and was to
the effect that as the City had had the option of
purchasing the steeple at even a less price than
Robinson had paid for it, and might have come to
some arrangement with the marquis to keep it in
repair, it could not prevent Robinson, who purchased
it as a speculation, making the best he could of his
bargain; so that, unless the City consented to accept
Robinson's offer to part with his property on payment
of his purchase-money and disbursements within a
fortnight, down the steeple must come.<a id="noteref_1207" name="noteref_1207" href="#note_1207"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1207</span></span></a></p>

religious houses in the city.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The relations existing between the civic authorities
and the religious houses in the city were often of
a most friendly and cordial character. When, in 1520,
the Friars of the Holy Cross wanted assistance for
the maintenance and building of their church, they
applied to the Corporation as being their "secund
founders."<a id="noteref_1209" name="noteref_1209" href="#note_1209"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1209</span></span></a> For assistance thus given the friars
bound themselves to pray for their benefactors.
When, in 1512, the master of St. Bartholomew's
hospital obtained a lease for ninety-nine years from
the City of a parcel of land on which his gatehouse
or porch stood, it was on condition of payment of a
certain rent and of his keeping a yearly obit in his
church for the souls of the mayor, aldermen and
commons of the city; and when the master of the
hospital, two years later, attempted to back out of<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page402">[pg 402]</span><a name="Pg402" id="Pg402" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the terms of his lease and asked to be discharged
from keeping the obit on the ground that he thought
that the payment of the specified rent was sufficient
for the premises, the Court of Aldermen unanimously
decided that no part of the agreement should be
minished or remitted.<a id="noteref_1210" name="noteref_1210" href="#note_1210"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1210</span></span></a> When the house of the
Sisters Minoresses or Poor Clares, situate in Aldgate,
suffered from fire, the Corporation rendered them
pecuniary aid to the extent of 300 marks.<a id="noteref_1211" name="noteref_1211" href="#note_1211"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1211</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was, however, to the Franciscans or Grey Friars
that the citizens of London, individually as well as in
their corporate capacity, were more especially attached.
Soon after their arrival in England in 1223, they
became indebted to the benevolence and generosity
of citizens, their first benefactor having been John
Ewen, citizen and mercer, who made them a gift of
some land and houses in the parish of St. Nicholas
by the Shambles. Upon this they erected their
original building. Their first chapel, which became
the chapel of their church, was built at the cost of
William Joyner, who was mayor in 1239; the nave
was added by Henry Waleys, who was frequently
mayor during the reign of Edward I; the chapterhouse
by Walter le Poter, elected sheriff in 1272; the
dormitory by Gregory de Rokesley, who was mayor
from 1274 to 1281, and again in 1284-5, and whose
bones eventually found a resting place in their church;
the refectory by another citizen, Bartholomew de
Castro; and lastly—coming to later times—a library
was added to their house by the bounty of Richard
Whitington, as already narrated. It became the custom
for the mayor and aldermen, as patron and<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page403">[pg 403]</span><a name="Pg403" id="Pg403" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc224" id="toc224"></a>
founders, to pay a yearly visit to their house and
church on St. Francis's day (4 Oct.). The custom
dates from 1508. In 1522 the visit was for the first
time followed by a dinner.<a id="noteref_1212" name="noteref_1212" href="#note_1212"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1212</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In one respect at least, if in no other, Cromwell's
action in suppressing religious houses resulted in a
benefit to the city of London as well as to the country
at large, and this was in the institution of parish
registers, not only for baptisms, but also for marriages.
It had been his intention to establish them in 1536 to
remedy the inconvenience to the public arising
from the suppression of the smaller monasteries,
and it is evident that some instructions were given at
this time, inasmuch as the registers of two city parishes—viz.,
St. James Garlickhithe and St. Mary Bothaw—commence
in November of this year,<a id="noteref_1213" name="noteref_1213" href="#note_1213"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1213</span></span></a> although
the royal injunction commanding that registers should
systematically be kept up, under penalty of fines, was
not published by Cromwell, as vicar-general, until the
29th September, 1538. The delay is to be accounted
for by the great discontent which the rumour of his
project excited in the country. It was reported that
some new tax on the services of the Church was contemplated,
and the first in the list of popular grievances
circulated by the rebels in the Pilgrimage of Grace
was the payment of tribute to the king for the
sacrament of baptism. In course of time, as matters
became quieter and the government began to feel its
own strength, Cromwell resumed a project never altogether
abandoned, and caused the injunction to be<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page404">[pg 404]</span><a name="Pg404" id="Pg404" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
issued, an action for which posterity must ever be
deeply grateful.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the other hand, the sudden closing of these
institutions caused the streets to be thronged with the
sick and poor, and the small parish churches to be so
crowded with those who had been accustomed to frequent
the larger and more commodious churches of
the friars that there was scarce room left for the
parishioners themselves. The city authorities saw at
once that something would have to be done if they
wished to keep their streets clear of beggars and of
invalids, and not invite the spread of sickness by
allowing infected persons to wander at large. As a
means of affording temporary relief, collections for the
poor were made every Sunday at Paul's Cross, after
the sermon, and the proceeds were distributed weekly
among the most necessitous,<a id="noteref_1214" name="noteref_1214" href="#note_1214"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1214</span></span></a> but more comprehensive
steps were required to be taken.</p>

to the king setting forth that there were three hospitals
in the city, viz., St. Mary's Spital, St. Bartholomew's
and St. Thomas's, besides the New Abbey on Tower
Hill—institutions primarily founded "onely for the

mayor and aldermen of the city for the time being
might have the order and disposition of the hospitals
mentioned, and of all the lands, tenements and revenues
appertaining to the same. If his grace would but
grant this request the mayor promised that a great
number of the indigent sick would be relieved, whilst
"sturdy beggars" not willing to work would be
punished.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In March, 1539, the City presented two petitions
to the king, one desiring that the late dissolved houses
might be made over to them, together with their rents
and revenues, in order that relief might be provided for
the sick and needy, and the other asking that Henry
would be pleased to convey to them the churches of the
late four orders of friars, together with their lands and
tenements, so that the mayor and citizens might take
order for the due performance of divine service therein
to the glory of God and the honour of the king.<a id="noteref_1217" name="noteref_1217" href="#note_1217"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1217</span></span></a>
These petitions having been either refused or ignored,
the Court of Common Council, on the 1st August,
1540, authorised the mayor and aldermen to make
diligent suit to the king for the purchase of the houses,
churches, and cloisters of the dissolved friars, and to
make an offer of 1,000 marks for them "yf thei can
be gotten no better chepe."<a id="noteref_1218" name="noteref_1218" href="#note_1218"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1218</span></span></a> Henry upbraided the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page406">[pg 406]</span><a name="Pg406" id="Pg406" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Henry meanwhile took the opportunity afforded
him by a full treasury, which rendered him independent
of the favour of the citizens, of robbing them of
their right of measuring linen-cloth and other commodities,
and conferring the same by letters patent
on John Godsalve, one of the clerks of the signet.
The City's right was incontestable, and had been
admitted by the king's chancellor, as well as by the
Chancellor of the Court of Fruits and Tenths (a court
recently established), and the mayor and aldermen
represented the facts of the case to the king himself
by letter, dated the 21st July, 1541.<a id="noteref_1220" name="noteref_1220" href="#note_1220"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1220</span></span></a> Another

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, in the spring of 1542, an incident occurred
which caused the relations between parliament and
the City to be somewhat strained. The sheriffs of
that year—Rowland Hill,<a id="noteref_1222" name="noteref_1222" href="#note_1222"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1222</span></span></a> an ancestor of the founder
of the Penny Post, and Henry Suckley—had thought
fit to obstruct the sergeant-at-mace in the execution
of his duty, whilst attempting to remove a
prisoner, who was a member of parliament, from<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page407">[pg 407]</span><a name="Pg407" id="Pg407" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc226" id="toc226"></a>
one of the compters. The arrest of a member
of parliament has always been a hazardous operation,
and the sheriffs after a time thought better of it and
gave up their prisoner. The Speaker, nevertheless,
summoned them to appear at the Bar of the House
and finally committed them to the Tower. They
were released after two or three days, however, at
the humble suit of the mayor.<a id="noteref_1223" name="noteref_1223" href="#note_1223"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1223</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the following year (1543) the plague returned,
and extra-precautions had to be taken against the
spread of the disease, now that the houses of the
friars were no longer open to receive patients and to
alleviate distress. Besides the usual order that infected
houses should be marked with a cross, the mayor
caused proclamation to be made that persons of independent
means should undergo quarantine for one
month after recovery from sickness, whilst others
whom necessity compelled to walk abroad for their
livelihood were to carry in their hands white rods,
two feet in length, for the space of forty days after
convalescence. Straw and rushes in an infected house
were to be removed to the fields before they were
burnt, and infected clothing was to be carried away
to be aired and not to be hung out of window. The
hard-heartedness engendered by these visitations is
evidenced by the necessity of the mayor having to
enjoin that thenceforth no householder within the
city or liberties should put any person stricken with
the plague out of his house into the street, without
making provision for his being kept in some other<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page408">[pg 408]</span><a name="Pg408" id="Pg408" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
house. All dogs other than hounds, spaniels or mastiffs
kept for the purpose of guarding the house were forthwith
to be removed out of the city or killed,
whilst watch-dogs were to be confined to the house.<a id="noteref_1224" name="noteref_1224" href="#note_1224"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1224</span></span></a>
In October the mayor was ordered to resume the
weekly bills of mortality, which of late had been
neglected, in order that the king might be kept informed
as to the increase or decrease of the sickness.<a id="noteref_1225" name="noteref_1225" href="#note_1225"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1225</span></span></a>

city, and the lord chancellor himself, accompanied by
officers of State, came into the city to read it. Finding
that the lord mayor's name appeared third on the
commission instead of being placed at its head, the
chancellor ordered the mistake to be at once rectified
by the town clerk and a new commission to be drawn
up, whilst the rest of the lords agreed that at their
several sessions on the business of this subsidy the
lord mayor should occupy the seat of honour.<a id="noteref_1228" name="noteref_1228" href="#note_1228"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1228</span></span></a> By

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Henry crossed over to France, leaving the new
queen, Catherine Parr, widow of Lord Latimer, whom
he had recently married, regent of the realm. After
a long siege, lasting from July until September, he
succeeded in taking Boulogne. On Thursday, the 25th
September, an order was received by the Court of
Aldermen from the lord chancellor, on behalf of the
queen regent, to get in readiness another contingent of
500 men well harnessed and weaponed, 100 of whom
were to be archers and the rest billmen. The last
mentioned were to be provided with "blak bylles or
morys pykes." The whole force was to be ready for
shipment to Boulogne by the following Saturday. No
time was to be lost. The wardens of the city
companies were immediately summoned, and each
company was ordered to provide the same number<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page410">[pg 410]</span><a name="Pg410" id="Pg410" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of men as on the last occasion. Each soldier was to
be provided with a coat of grey frieze, with half
sleeves, and a pair of new boots or else "sterte upps."
The Corporation for its part appointed five captains,
to each of whom was given the sum of £10 towards
his apparel and charges, whilst £5 was allowed to
each petty captain. These sums were paid out of the
"goods" of the mayor and commonalty.<a id="noteref_1232" name="noteref_1232" href="#note_1232"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1232</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Scarcely had the city recovered from this drain
upon its population before it was again called upon to
fill up the ranks of the army in France. On Saturday,
the 25th October, the Court of Aldermen was ordered
to raise another force of 500 men by the following
Monday. It was no easy matter to comply with so
sudden a demand. The city companies were called
upon to contribute as before, any deficiency in the
number of men raised by them being made up by
men raised by the mayor and aldermen themselves
in a somewhat novel fashion. The Court of Aldermen
had agreed that each of their number should on
the Saturday night make the round of his ward and
select "fifty, forty, twenty, or ten" tall and comely men,
who should be warned in the king's name to appear
the next morning before seven o'clock at the Guildhall.
On Sunday morning the mayor and aldermen
came to the Guildhall, and took the names of those
whom they had selected over night. Two hundred
men were eventually set apart to make up the
deficiency of those to be provided by the companies.
By six o'clock in the evening the whole contingent of
500 men was thus raised, and at nine o'clock on
Monday morning they mustered at Leadenhall,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page411">[pg 411]</span><a name="Pg411" id="Pg411" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc228" id="toc228"></a>
whence they were conducted by the sheriffs and city
chamberlain to the Tower Hill and handed over to
Sir Thomas Arundel, who complimented the civic

to commend their diligence to the king.<a id="noteref_1233" name="noteref_1233" href="#note_1233"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1233</span></span></a> This same

once more paid a visit to the city (12 June) and sat
in the Guildhall. Every alderman was straitly
charged to call before him every person in his ward

were read to the Court of Aldermen touching the

squadron had appeared off the south coast. It
was resolved to adjourn consideration of the message
until the following Monday, when the lord chancellor
and other lords of the council would again be coming
into the city for the subsidy, and their advice could
be asked. The outcome of these letters was that the
City had to raise a force of 2,000 able men. To do this
an assessment of a fifteenth was ordered to be levied
on the wards, but in the meantime the money so to
be raised was to be advanced by the aldermen.<a id="noteref_1245" name="noteref_1245" href="#note_1245"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1245</span></span></a> Not

In the meantime a man was despatched by the Court

Guildford. The cheese was to be sent by water as

"the good industrye and help of Master Judde, alderman,"
to its destination. The bakers of Stratford
contracted to send two cart-loads of bread. It was
further agreed on the same day that Christopher
Fowlke should forthwith go to Guildford, and further

Henry now had leisure to turn his attention to home
affairs, and more particularly to the establishment of
that uniformity which he so much desired, and
which he endeavoured to bring about by getting rid
of all those who differed in opinion from himself.
Those who openly declared their disbelief in any one
of the "Six Articles," and more particularly in the
first article, which established the doctrine of the real
presence, ran the risk of death by the gallows, the
block or the stake. A city rector, Dr. Crome, of the
church of St. Mary Aldermary, got into disgrace for
speaking lightly of the benefits to be derived from
private masses, and, although his argument tended to
minimise the effect of the recent confiscation of so
many chantries, he was called upon to make a public
recantation at Paul's Cross.<a id="noteref_1252" name="noteref_1252" href="#note_1252"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1252</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Others were not so compliant. Among these was
Anne Ascue or Ascough, a daughter of Sir William
Ascough, of Kelsey, in Lincolnshire, and sometimes
known as Anne Kyme, from the name of her husband,
with whom she had ceased to live. In June, 1545,
she and some others, among whom was another
woman, Joan, wife of John Sauterie, of London, had<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page416">[pg 416]</span><a name="Pg416" id="Pg416" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
been arraigned at the Guildhall "for speaking against

was again in custody. On the 18th June, 1546, she
was tried at the Guildhall and condemned to be
burned alive as a heretic at Smithfield, where the city
chamberlain had orders to erect a "substantial stage,"
whence the king's council and the civic authorities
might witness the scene.<a id="noteref_1254" name="noteref_1254" href="#note_1254"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1254</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The insanitary condition of the city, occasioned
for the most part by an insufficient supply of water,
was not improved by the influx of disbanded and
invalided soldiers, followed by a swarm of vagabonds
and idlers, which took place at the conclusion of
peace with France. To the soldiers licences were
granted to solicit alms for longer or shorter periods,
whilst the vagabonds were ordered to quit the city.<a id="noteref_1255" name="noteref_1255" href="#note_1255"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1255</span></span></a>
The water question had been taken in hand by the
Common Council towards the close of the preceding
year (1545), when Sir Martin Bowes entered upon
his mayoralty, and a tax of two fifteenths was
imposed upon the inhabitants of the city for the
purpose of conveying fresh water from certain
"lively sprynges" recently discovered at Hackney.<a id="noteref_1256" name="noteref_1256" href="#note_1256"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1256</span></span></a>
Bowes himself was very energetic in the matter,
and before he went out of office he had the satisfaction
of seeing a plentiful supply of water brought
into the heart of the city from the suburban manor
of Finsbury.<a id="noteref_1257" name="noteref_1257" href="#note_1257"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1257</span></span></a></p>

the crown on Henry's death by an Act of Parliament
passed in 1544, and the princesses Mary and Elizabeth
were thereby re-instated in their rights of
inheritance as if no question of their legitimacy had
ever been raised. As Edward, who was next in
succession to the crown, was but a boy, Henry had
taken pains to select a council of regency in which
no one party should predominate. This council was
soon set aside, and Hertford, the king's uncle, got
himself appointed Protector of the realm and took
the title of Duke of Somerset. At the time of his
father's death Edward was residing at Hertford Castle.
He was soon afterwards carried thence by his uncle
to London and lodged in the Tower, where the mayor,
Henry Hoberthorne, went to pay his respects and
received the honour of knighthood.<a id="noteref_1266" name="noteref_1266" href="#note_1266"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1266</span></span></a></p>

The streets were lined with members of the livery

Chepe, the Ludgate and the Temple Bar had been
freshly painted and trimmed with goodly hangings of
Arras and cloth of gold for the occasion. At three of
the conduits, namely, the conduit in Cornhill, the
great conduit in Chepe, and the conduit in Fleet
Street, wine was made by artificial means to flow as

At the little conduit in Chepe were stationed the
aldermen of the city, in their scarlet gowns, and the
Recorder, who, in the name of the whole city, presented
his majesty with 1,000 marks in "hole new

which his majesty deigned to accept with his own
hand. The next day Edward was crowned. The lord
mayor, according to custom, attended with his crystal

thence, after mass, to Westminster Hall, and received

the oath of five independent witnesses to have been
heard to say "that the masse was nawght, and the

up and down in St. Bride's Church before the sacrament,
disturbing the priests at mass and creating a
tumult. By way of punishment for his offence he was
set in the cage in Fleet Street, "disguised" as he was,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page423">[pg 423]</span><a name="Pg423" id="Pg423" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc236" id="toc236"></a>
with a paper on his head setting forth his offence.
He there remained until four o'clock in the afternoon,
when he was removed to the compter and condemned
to stay there a prisoner until he found sureties for
good behaviour.<a id="noteref_1274" name="noteref_1274" href="#note_1274"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1274</span></span></a></p>

curate that, about a month before, after reciting the
common prayers at the choir door at high mass, he
had prayed among other things that Almighty God
might send the king's council grace and bring them
out of the erroneous opinions that they were then in.
The informer went on to say that Sir Clement Smith
and the Recorder, who were present, laughed at the
prayer. But inasmuch as the informer had not been
present himself, and that what he had laid before the

paid to it.<a id="noteref_1279" name="noteref_1279" href="#note_1279"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1279</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The abolition of chantries initiated by Henry
VIII was carried out to a fuller extent by his successor.
The statute (1 Edward VI, cap 14) by which
this was effected not only deprived a large number of
priests of a means of livelihood, but laid them open to
insult from those they met in the street. They complained
that they could not walk abroad nor attend

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same statute—by declaring all chantries,
obits, lights and lamps to be objects of superstitious
use, and all goods, chattels, jewels, plate, ornaments
and other moveables hitherto devoted to their maintenance
to be thenceforth escheated to the Crown—dealt
a heavy blow to the Corporation of the City of
London, as well as to the civic companies and other
bodies who owned property subject to certain payments
under one or other of these heads. Three years after<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page425">[pg 425]</span><a name="Pg425" id="Pg425" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc237" id="toc237"></a>
the passing of the Act the Corporation and the companies
redeemed certain charges of this character on
their respective properties to the amount of £939 2<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">s.</span></span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The redemption of these and other charges of a
similar character, whilst very convenient to the Crown,
saving the trouble and expense of collecting small
sums of money, worked a hardship upon the Corporation
and the companies. In order to raise funds
for redeeming the charges they were obliged to
sell property. This property was often held under
conditions of reverter and remainders over, unless
what was now declared to be illegal was religiously
carried out. It was manifestly unfair that they should
be made to forfeit property because the conditions
under which it was held could no longer be legally
complied with. A petition therefore was presented
to the king in order to obviate this difficulty, and to
enable them to part with the necessary property and
at the same time to give a clear title.<a id="noteref_1282" name="noteref_1282" href="#note_1282"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1282</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime (Aug., 1547) an order had gone
forth for the demolition of all images and removal of
pictures and stained glass from churches. The instructions
sent to the lord mayor were very precise.
"Stories made in glasse wyndows" relative to Thomas
Becket were to be altered at as little expense as possible.
Images and pictures to which no offerings and no
prayers were made might remain for "garnisshement"<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page426">[pg 426]</span><a name="Pg426" id="Pg426" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the churches; and if any such had been taken down
the mayor was at liberty to set them up again, unless
they had been taken down by order of the king's
commissioners or the parson of the church. If there
existed in any church a "storye in glasse" of the
Bishop of Rome, otherwise the Pope, the mayor
might paint out the papal tiara and alter the "storye."<a id="noteref_1283" name="noteref_1283" href="#note_1283"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1283</span></span></a>
These instructions, contained in a letter from the
king's council, were duly considered at a Court of
Aldermen held on the 22nd September, with the
result that every alderman was ordered, in the most
secret, discreet and quiet manner he could devise, to
visit each parish church in his ward, and to take with
him the parson or curate and two or three honest
parishioners, churchwardens or others who had had
anything to do with the removal of the images that
had already been taken down, and, having shut
the church door for the sake of privacy, to take a
note in writing of what images had formerly been
in the several churches, what images had offerings
and were prayed to, and what not; who had removed
those taken down, and what had been done
with them. A report was to be made on these points
by every alderman at the next court, so that the
lords of the council might be informed thereon and
their will ascertained before any further steps were
taken.<a id="noteref_1284" name="noteref_1284" href="#note_1284"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1284</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The havoc worked by the king's commissioners
in the city and throughout the country by the reckless
destruction of works of art was terrible. The
churches were stripped of every ornament, their walls<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page427">[pg 427]</span><a name="Pg427" id="Pg427" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc238" id="toc238"></a>
whitewashed, and only relieved by the tables of
the commandments. Early in September the commissioners
visited St. Paul's and pulled down all the
images. In November the rood was taken down
with its images of the Virgin and St. John. The great
cross of the rood fell down accidentally and killed
one of the workmen, a circumstance which many
ascribed to the special intervention of the Almighty.
From St. Paul's the commissioners proceeded to the
church of St. Bride, and so from parish church to
parish church.<a id="noteref_1285" name="noteref_1285" href="#note_1285"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1285</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the following year (1548) the chapel of St.
Paul's charnel house was pulled down and the
bones removed into the country and reburied. From
a sanitary point of view their removal is to be commended.
There is no such excuse, however, for the
destruction of the cloister in Pardon churchyard
(April, 1549), with its famous picture of the Dance
of Death, painted at the expense of John Carpenter, the
town clerk of the city, of whom mention has already
been made. The fact was that the Protector Somerset
required material for building his new palace in
the Strand,<a id="noteref_1286" name="noteref_1286" href="#note_1286"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1286</span></span></a> to enlarge which he had already pulled

necessitated a new order of procession on the next
Lord Mayor's Day (24 Oct.), when Sir Rowland Hill
paid the customary visit to St. Paul's, made a circuit<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page428">[pg 428]</span><a name="Pg428" id="Pg428" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the interior of the cathedral, and said a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De profundis</span></span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor can the civic authorities themselves be altogether
acquitted of vandalism. They destroyed the
churches of St. Nicholas Shambles and St. Ewin, and
sold the plate and windows, but the proceeds were
distributed among the poor.<a id="noteref_1289" name="noteref_1289" href="#note_1289"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1289</span></span></a> They went further than
this. They removed the fine tombs and altars, as well
as the choir stalls, from the church of the Grey Friars,
where mingled the ashes of some of the noblest and
best in the land. There was some excuse, however,
for these acts. The house and church of the Grey
Friars had been granted to the City at the close of
the last reign on the express condition that the
churches of St. Nicholas and St. Ewin should be
abolished, and that the church of the Grey Friars
should be established as a parish church in their
place under the name of Christ Church. It was
probably in order to render the old monastic church
more convenient as a parish church that they removed
much of what to the antiquary of to-day would
have seemed of priceless value, and at the same time
reduced the dimensions of the choir.<a id="noteref_1290" name="noteref_1290" href="#note_1290"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1290</span></span></a></p>

of the mayor on the following Michaelmas-day, on
which occasion a mass had always been celebrated at
the Guildhall Chapel since the time of Whitington, an
endeavour appears to have been made by the Court
of Aldermen to effect a compromise between mass
and communion, for whilst it ordered that a mass of
the Holy Ghost should be solemnly sung in English
in the Guildhall Chapel (which had been confiscated
by Henry VIII)<a id="noteref_1292" name="noteref_1292" href="#note_1292"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1292</span></span></a> as theretofore, it further ordered

Orders were issued by the king's council that candles
should no longer be carried about on Candlemas-day,
ashes on Ash Wednesday, palms on Palm Sunday.
These practices were now considered superstitious, as
also was the "sensyng" which hitherto had taken
place in St. Paul's at Whitsuntide, but which the
Court of Aldermen now decreed to be abolished, and
the preaching of sermons substituted in its place.<a id="noteref_1294" name="noteref_1294" href="#note_1294"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1294</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The people were at this time extremely distracted
by the various and contradictory opinions of their
preachers; and as they were totally incapable of judging
of the force of arguments adduced on one side or
the other, but conceived that everything spoken from
the pulpit was of equal authority, great confusion and
perplexity of mind ensued. In order to "tune the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page430">[pg 430]</span><a name="Pg430" id="Pg430" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
pulpits" and to effect uniformity of doctrine and
service, the Lord Protector resorted to proclamations,
which, although no longer having the authority of
statutes as in the reign of Henry VIII, practically
answered the same purpose. Preaching was thus
restricted to those who had previously obtained a
licence from the king, his visitors, the archbishop of
Canterbury, or the bishop of the diocese.<a id="noteref_1295" name="noteref_1295" href="#note_1295"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1295</span></span></a> The same
want of uniformity which appeared in the preachers
appeared also in their congregations; some "kepte

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime great discontent had been caused
by the Protector's measures. The rich nobleman and
country gentleman said nothing, for their assent had
been purchased by gifts of church property, but the
tenants and bourgeois class suffered from increased
rents, from enclosures and evictions. Church lands
had always been underlet; the monks were easy
landlords. Not so the new proprietors of the confiscated
abbey lands, they were determined to make
the most out of their newly-acquired property.<a id="noteref_1297" name="noteref_1297" href="#note_1297"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1297</span></span></a>

country. Not only were enclosures thrown open and
fences removed, but a cry was raised for the restoration
of the old religion. Information of what was
taking place was sent to Sir Henry Amcotes, the
mayor, and steps were at once taken (2 July, 1549)
for putting the city into a state of defence and for the
preservation of the king's peace. A "false draw-brydge"
was ordered (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">inter alia</span></span>) to be made for
London Bridge "in case nede should requyer by reason

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the midst of these preparations there was a
lull. On the 21st day of July, being the 6th Sunday
after Trinity, came Archbishop Cranmer to St. Paul's.
He wore no vestment save a cope over an alb, and
bore neither mitre nor cross, but only a staff. He
conducted the whole of the service as set out in the
"king's book" recently published, which differed but
slightly from the church service in use at the present
day, and he administered the "Communion" to himself,
the dean and others, according to Act of Parliament.
The mayor and most of the aldermen occupied
seats in the choir. Cranmer's object in coming to the
city on that day was to exhort the citizens to obey the
king as the supreme head of the realm, and to pray the
Almighty to avert the trouble with which, for their
sins, they were threatened.<a id="noteref_1300" name="noteref_1300" href="#note_1300"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1300</span></span></a></p>

accompanied by the Lord Protector and other nobles.
The mayor and aldermen rode out to Southwark, the
former in a gown of crimson velvet, the latter in
gowns of scarlet, to meet the royal party, and conducted
it as far as Charing Cross, where the aldermen took
their leave, the king saluting them and "putting of

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The aspect of affairs began to look black indeed.
By the end of the month Exeter was being besieged
by the rebels, and on the 8th August the French
ambassador, taking advantage of the general distraction,
bade the Lord Protector open defiance at
Whitehall.<a id="noteref_1302" name="noteref_1302" href="#note_1302"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1302</span></span></a> At midnight instructions were sent to
the mayor to seize all Frenchmen in the city who
were not denizens, together with their property.
By this time, however, Exeter had been relieved and
the insurrection in the west had been put down.
The western insurgents had demanded the restoration
of the mass and the abolition of the English liturgy.
Contemporaneously with this religious movement
another agitation was being made in the eastern
counties, and more especially in Norfolk, which had
for its object the destruction of enclosures. With the
eastern rebels, who placed themselves under the
leadership of Robert Ket, a tanner of Wymondham,
the Protector himself sympathized at heart, and the
council had to exercise no little pressure before he
could be induced to send an efficient force to put them
down. At length the rebels were met and defeated<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page433">[pg 433]</span><a name="Pg433" id="Pg433" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc241" id="toc241"></a>
by a force under the command of the Earl of
Warwick, the son of the extortionate Dudley who
was associated with Empson in oppressing the city
towards the close of the reign of Henry VII. Ket
galloped off the field, leaving his followers to be
ridden down and killed by the earl's horsemen. He
was shortly afterwards captured in a barn, and
eventually brought up to London, together with his
brother William, and committed to the Tower.
Being arraigned and convicted of treason, they were
handed over to the high sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk.
Robert was hanged in chains on the top of Norwich
Castle, whilst his brother William suffered a similar
fate on the top of Wymondham Steeple.<a id="noteref_1303" name="noteref_1303" href="#note_1303"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1303</span></span></a></p>

hated him, not for his favouring the reformers, but
for the injury he had caused to trade and for his
having bebased the coinage still further than it had

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the afternoon of Sunday, the 6th October,
1549, a letter was sent to the mayor subscribed by
Lord St. John, the president of the council, the earls
of Warwick, Southampton and Arundel, and other
members of the council, containing a long indictment
of the Protector's policy and conduct. He was proud,
covetous and ambitious. He had embezzled the pay
of the soldiers, with which he was building sumptuous<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page434">[pg 434]</span><a name="Pg434" id="Pg434" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
houses in four or five different places. Whilst sowing
discord among the nobles, he flattered the commons
to the intent that, having got rid of the former, he
might with the aid of the latter achieve his scarcely
veiled design of supplanting the king himself. They
had hoped, the letter continues, to have persuaded
the duke by fair means to take order for the security
of the king's person and the commonwealth; but no
sooner was the matter broached to the duke than he
showed himself determined to appeal to the arbitrament
of the sword. Such being the case, they on
their part were no less resolved, with God's help, to
deliver the king and the realm from impending ruin,

was spent in removing some of Somerset's followers;

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There were some who looked upon Somerset's
fall as an act of God's vengeance for his having caused
Bonner to be deprived of his bishopric of London.
On the 1st September last Bonner had preached at
Paul's Cross against the king's supremacy. Information
of the matter was given to the council, and
Bonner was called upon to answer for his conduct
before Cranmer and the rest of the commissioners.
The informers on this occasion were William Latymer,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page439">[pg 439]</span><a name="Pg439" id="Pg439" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc244" id="toc244"></a>
the parson of the church of St. Laurence Pountney,
and John Hooper, a zealous Protestant, who afterwards
became Bishop of Gloucester. Whilst under
examination before the commissioners Bonner was
confined in the Marshalsea. Hooper in the meantime
was put up by Cranmer to preach at Paul's Cross,
and he took the opportunity thus afforded him of
inveighing strongly against Bonner's conduct. Bonner
failed to satisfy the commissioners, and on the 1st
October was deprived of office and committed to
prison during the king's pleasure. "But marke what
followeth," writes the chronicler of the Grey Friars,
within a week "was proclaymyd the protector a

it was known as Suffolk House. It was now used in

dinner the king knighted York in recognition of his
hospitality and his past services, an honour personal
to York and not extended to his colleague in the
shrievalty, Richard Turke. From Southwark Edward
set forth to ride through the city to Westminster,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With Warwick, who became the ruling spirit of
the council after the fall of Somerset and the abolition
of the protectorate, religion was a matter of supreme
indifference, and for a time it was uncertain whether
he would favour the followers of the old religion or
the advanced reformers. He chose to extend his
patronage to the latter. The day after Somerset's
release from the Tower, Bonner was again brought
from the Marshalsea, where he had been roughly used,<a id="noteref_1322" name="noteref_1322" href="#note_1322"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1322</span></span></a>
and the cause of his deprivation reconsidered by the
lords of the council sitting in the Star Chamber, the
result being that the previous sentence by Cranmer
was confirmed and Bonner again relegated to prison.
Bishops were now appointed directly by the king,
who in the following April caused Nicholas Ridley,
bishop of Rochester, to be transferred to London in
Bonner's place; and the see of Westminster,<a id="noteref_1323" name="noteref_1323" href="#note_1323"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1323</span></span></a> which<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page441">[pg 441]</span><a name="Pg441" id="Pg441" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc245" id="toc245"></a>

July Hooper was nominated to the see of Gloucester;

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For some time past the City had experienced
difficulty in exercising its franchise in the borough of
Southwark. That borough consisted of three manors,
known respectively as the Guildable Manor, the
King's Manor and the Great Liberty Manor.<a id="noteref_1325" name="noteref_1325" href="#note_1325"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1325</span></span></a> The
first of these—and only the first—had been granted
to the City by Edward III soon after his accession.
The civic authorities had complained of felons making
good their escape from the city to Southwark, where
they could not be attacked by the officers of the city;
and the king, in answer to the City's request, had made
over to them the town or vill of Southwark.<a id="noteref_1326" name="noteref_1326" href="#note_1326"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1326</span></span></a> This
grant was afterwards confirmed and amplified by
a charter granted by Edward IV in 1462, whereby
the citizens were allowed to hold a yearly fair in the
borough on three successive days in the month of
September, together with a court of pie-powder, and
with all liberties and customs to such fair appertaining.<a id="noteref_1327" name="noteref_1327" href="#note_1327"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1327</span></span></a>
In course of time the City claimed the right of holding
a market, as well as the yearly fair, twice a week in<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page442">[pg 442]</span><a name="Pg442" id="Pg442" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Southwark. This claim now led to difficulties with
the king's bailiff, Sir John Gate. A draft agreement
had been drawn up during Somerset's protectorate in
the hopes of arranging matters,<a id="noteref_1328" name="noteref_1328" href="#note_1328"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1328</span></span></a> but apparently without

divers messuages in Southwark, with the exception of
"Southwark Place" and the gardens belonging to it,
formerly the Duke of Suffolk's mansion, and for a
further sum of 500 marks he surrendered all the royal
liberties and franchises which he or his heirs might
have in the borough or town of Southwark. It was
expressly provided that this charter was not to be
prejudicial to Sir John Gate or to his property and
interests. The ancient rent of £10 per annum was
still to be paid, and the citizens were to be allowed
to hold four markets every week in addition to a fair
and court of pie-powder enjoyed since the time of
Edward IV. On the 9th May the lord mayor took
formal possession of the borough of Southwark by
riding through the precinct, after which the Common
Cryer made proclamation with sound of trumpet for<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page443">[pg 443]</span><a name="Pg443" id="Pg443" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc246" id="toc246"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was originally intended, no doubt, that the
borough should be incorporated for all municipal
purposes with the city, and that the inhabitants of
the borough should be placed on the same footing as
the citizens. This, however, was never carried out.
Notwithstanding the fact that among the ordinances
drawn up (31 July) for the government of the
borough,<a id="noteref_1332" name="noteref_1332" href="#note_1332"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1332</span></span></a> there was one which prescribed the same
customary procedure in the election of an alderman
for the new ward of Bridge Without as prevailed in
the city;<a id="noteref_1333" name="noteref_1333" href="#note_1333"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1333</span></span></a> the inhabitants of the borough have never
taken any part in the election of an alderman. The
first alderman, Sir John Aylyff, a barber-surgeon, was
"nominated, elected and chosen" by the Court of
Aldermen,<a id="noteref_1334" name="noteref_1334" href="#note_1334"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1334</span></span></a> and was admitted and sworn before the
same body on the 28th May, 1850—that is to say,
some weeks before the ordinances just mentioned
were drawn up.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The alderman of the ward continued to be
nominated and elected by the Court of Aldermen<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page444">[pg 444]</span><a name="Pg444" id="Pg444" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
until 1711, when, by virtue of an Act of Common
Council, the ward was to be offered to the several aldermen
who had served as mayor, in order of seniority. If
no alderman could be found willing to be translated
from his own ward to that of Bridge Without, the
Court of Common Council was empowered by another
Act passed in 1725 to proceed to the election of an
alderman.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ward of Bridge Without has never sent
representatives to the Common Council, inasmuch as
its inhabitants refused to "take up their freedom"
and bear the burdens of citizenship, and there existed no
means for forcing the freedom upon them. In 1835,
however, a petition was presented to the Common
Council by certain inhabitants of Southwark asking
that they might for the future exercise the right of
electing not only an alderman, but common council-men
for the ward, and that the ordinances of 1550
might be carried out according to their original
intention. The petition was referred to the Committee
for General Purposes, who reported to the
Common Council<a id="noteref_1335" name="noteref_1335" href="#note_1335"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1335</span></span></a> to the effect that, considering that
the borough of Southwark had never formed part of
the City of London, the charter of Edward VI notwithstanding,
and that the holding of wardmotes in
the borough would materially interfere with the duties
of an ancient officer known as a seneschal or steward
of Southwark, the petition could not be complied with,
except by application to the legislature, and that such
a course would neither be expedient or advisable.

peace with France (29 March, 1550). This he accomplished
only by consenting to surrender Boulogne.
The declaration of peace was celebrated with bonfires
in the city, although the conditions under which
the peace was effected were generally unacceptable
to the nation and brought discredit upon the earl.<a id="noteref_1337" name="noteref_1337" href="#note_1337"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1337</span></span></a>
One result of the conclusion of the war was again
to flood the streets of the city with men who openly
declared that they neither could nor would work,
and that unless the king provided them with a
livelihood they would combine to plunder the city,
and once clear with their booty they cared not if
10,000 men were after them. It was in vain that
proclamation was made for all disbanded soldiers to
leave the city. They refused to go, and oftentimes
came into conflict with the city constables. At length
the mayor and aldermen addressed a letter on the
subject to the lords of the council (25 Sept.).<a id="noteref_1338" name="noteref_1338" href="#note_1338"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1338</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the following year the state of the city was
rendered worse by a proposal of Warwick to debase
the currency yet more. As soon as the proposal got
wind up went the price of provisions, in spite of every
effort made by the lords of the council to keep it
down. They sent for the mayor (Sir Andrew Judd) to<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page446">[pg 446]</span><a name="Pg446" id="Pg446" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
attend them at Greenwich on Sunday, the 10th May,
and soundly rated him—or, as the chronicler puts
it, "gave him some sore words"—for allowing such
things to take place. On Thursday, the 28th, the
mayor summoned a Common Council, when the
Recorder repeated to them the king's orders that the
price of wares was not to be raised. The livery
companies were to see to it, and there were to be
no more murmurings.<a id="noteref_1339" name="noteref_1339" href="#note_1339"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1339</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Warwick himself excited the anger of the city burgesses
by riding through the streets to see if the king's
orders against the enhancement of the price of victuals
were being carried out. Coming one day to a butcher's
in Eastcheap, he asked the price of a sheep. Being
told that it was 13 shillings, he replied that it was too
much and passed on. When another butcher asked
16 shillings he was told to go and be hanged. The
earl's conduct so roused the indignation of the butchers
of the city—a class of men scarcely less powerful than
their brethren the fishmongers—that they made no
secret that the price of meat would be raised still
more if the debasement of the currency was carried
out as proposed.<a id="noteref_1340" name="noteref_1340" href="#note_1340"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1340</span></span></a> Yet, in spite of all remonstrances
and threats, a proclamation went forth that after the
17th August the shilling should be current for six pence
sterling and no more, the groat for two pence, the
penny for a halfpenny, and the halfpenny for a farthing.<a id="noteref_1341" name="noteref_1341" href="#note_1341"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1341</span></span></a>
The price of every commodity rose 50 per
cent. as a matter of course, and nothing that Warwick<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page447">[pg 447]</span><a name="Pg447" id="Pg447" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc248" id="toc248"></a>
could do could prevent it. Seeing at last the hopelessness
of attempting to overcome economic laws by
a mere <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ipse dixit</span></span>, he caused a "contrary proclamasyon"

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Warwick's increasing unpopularity raised a hope
in the breast of Somerset of recovering his lost power.
Some rash words he had allowed to escape were
carried to the young king, who took the part of
Warwick against his own uncle, and showed his
appreciation of the earl's services by creating him
Duke of Northumberland (11 Oct.). A few days later
Somerset was seized and again committed to the
Tower.<a id="noteref_1343" name="noteref_1343" href="#note_1343"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1343</span></span></a> The new duke vaunted himself more than

attempting to snatch at his chain of office as he
accompanied the mayor to service at St. Paul's on
All Saints' Day, and otherwise creating no little
disturbance in St. Paul's Churchyard. The mayor
waited until service was over, and then took them
into custody.<a id="noteref_1345" name="noteref_1345" href="#note_1345"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1345</span></span></a></p>

Acre. When they discovered that he had been found
guilty of felony and condemned to be executed they
were grievously disappointed. As he landed at the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meanwhile the civic authorities had been
energetically engaged in making regulations for the
hospital of the poor in West Smithfield, better known
as St. Bartholomew's Hospital, which they had recently
acquired, and in grappling with the poverty and sickness
with which they were surrounded. Instead of
trusting to the charity of those attending the parish
churches on Sunday for raising money for the poor,
the Common Council, in September, 1547, resorted to
the less precarious method of levying on every inhabitant
of the city one half of a fifteenth for the maintenance
of the poor of the hospital.<a id="noteref_1350" name="noteref_1350" href="#note_1350"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1350</span></span></a> The voluntary
system, however, was not wholly abolished. In the
following April (1548) a brotherhood for the relief of
the poor had been established, to which the mayor (Sir
John Gresham) and most of the aldermen belonged,
each agreeing to subscribe a yearly sum varying from
half a mark to a mark.<a id="noteref_1351" name="noteref_1351" href="#note_1351"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1351</span></span></a> In September governors

December the Common Council passed an Act for the

being levied on the livery companies.<a id="noteref_1353" name="noteref_1353" href="#note_1353"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1353</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1551 the City succeeded in obtaining another
hospital. This was the hospital in Southwark originally
dedicated to Thomas Becket, but whose patron<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page450">[pg 450]</span><a name="Pg450" id="Pg450" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
saint was, after the Reformation, changed to St.

February with the lord chancellor for the purchase of
this hospital.<a id="noteref_1354" name="noteref_1354" href="#note_1354"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1354</span></span></a> They proceeded so favourably that by
the 12th August the hospital and church and part of
their endowment were conveyed to the City by deed,
whilst the rest of the endowment was transferred by
another deed on the following day.<a id="noteref_1355" name="noteref_1355" href="#note_1355"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1355</span></span></a> The purchase-money

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">Christ's Hospital.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having thus cared for the sick and the poor, the
civic authorities next turned their attention to the
conversion of a portion of the ground and buildings
of the dissolved monastery of the Grey Friars into a
hospital for the reception and education of fatherless
and helpless children. In 1552 Sir Richard Dobbs<a id="noteref_1356" name="noteref_1356" href="#note_1356"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1356</span></span></a>
was mayor. He took an active part in the charitable
work that was then being carried on in the city, and
his conduct so won the heart of Ridley that the
bishop wrote from prison shortly before his death
commending him in the highest possible terms:—"O
Dobbs, Dobbs, alderman and knight, thou in thy
year did'st win my heart for evermore, for that
honourable act, that most blessed work of God,
of the erection and setting up of Christ's Holy
Hospitals, and truly religious houses which by thee
and through thee were begun." In July the work
of adapting the old buildings, rather than erecting
new, was commenced, and in a few months the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page451">[pg 451]</span><a name="Pg451" id="Pg451" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc250" id="toc250"></a>
premises were sufficiently forward to admit of the
reception of nearly 400 children. The charity was
aided by the king's bestowal of the linen vestures
used in the city prior to the Reformation, and at that
time seized by the commissioners.<a id="noteref_1357" name="noteref_1357" href="#note_1357"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1357</span></span></a> Just as the close
of the reign of Henry VIII had witnessed the reopening
of the church of the Grey Friars under the
name of Christchurch, and the celebration of the
mass once more within its walls, so now the close of
his son's short reign witnessed the restoration of their
house and buildings, and their conversion, in the cause
of education and charity, into Christ's Hospital.</p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">Bridewell Hospital.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There was yet another class of inhabitant to
be provided for, namely, those who either could not
or would not work. On behalf of these a deputation<a id="noteref_1358" name="noteref_1358" href="#note_1358"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1358</span></span></a>
was appointed by the City to present a petition to
the king that he would be pleased to grant the
disused palace of Bridewell to the municipality for
the purpose of turning it into a workhouse. The
deputation was introduced by Ridley, who himself
wrote in May of this year (1552) to secretary Cecil
on the same subject.<a id="noteref_1359" name="noteref_1359" href="#note_1359"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1359</span></span></a> The efforts of the bishop and
the deputation were rewarded with success. In the
following spring (1553) the king not only consented
to convey the palace to the municipal body, but
further gave 700 marks and all the beds and bedding
of his palace of the Savoy for the maintenance of<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page452">[pg 452]</span><a name="Pg452" id="Pg452" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

possessed of the several hospitals of St. Bartholomew,
St. Thomas, Christ's and Bridewell, the king, a few
days before his death, granted the mayor, aldermen

governors of these Royal Hospitals in the city.<a id="noteref_1361" name="noteref_1361" href="#note_1361"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1361</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The death of Edward VI took place on the 6th
July, 1553, although it was not generally known until
two days afterwards. By his father's will the Princess
Mary became heiress to the throne. Northumberland
was aware of this. He was equally aware that if
Mary succeeded to her brother's crown matters might
go hard with him. He therefore persuaded Edward
to follow the precedent set by his father and re-settle
the succession to the crown by will. He succeeded
moreover in getting the late king to name as his successor
the Lady Jane Grey, grand-daughter of Mary
Duchess of Suffolk, the younger sister of Henry VIII,
and he took the further precaution of marrying her to
his own son, Lord Guildford Dudley. It was in vain
that the judges and law officers of the Crown pointed
out that the Act of Parliament which authorised
Henry to dispose of the crown by will, in the case of
his children dying without heirs, did not apply to
Edward. Councillors and judges, and even Cranmer
himself, were forced to signify their assent by subscribing
to the will, which was dated (21 June) a
fortnight only before Edward's death.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Northumberland well knew the advantage to be
got by securing the co-operation of the city in prosecuting
his scheme, so he persuaded the mayor (Sir George
Barnes), a number of aldermen (including Sir John
Gresham, Sir Andrew Judd, Thomas Offley and Sir<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page454">[pg 454]</span><a name="Pg454" id="Pg454" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Richard Dobbs), and several of the leading merchants
of the city to append their signatures to the will.<a id="noteref_1362" name="noteref_1362" href="#note_1362"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1362</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 10th July the Lady Jane was brought from
Richmond and lodged in the Tower, and that same
evening was proclaimed queen at the Cross in Chepe.
The mayor took no part in the ceremony, and only
one of the sheriffs (William Gerard or Garrard)
attended the heralds. If Northumberland thought
that the citizens would favour Lady Jane merely
because she was a Protestant he was mistaken. The
proclamation was received with undisguised coldness,
and "few or none said God save her."<a id="noteref_1364" name="noteref_1364" href="#note_1364"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1364</span></span></a> Nor was it
better received by the country at large. The eastern
counties rose and in a few days Mary was at the
head of 30,000 men. No time was to be lost, and
Northumberland at once set out from London to
meet her. As he passed through the city he noticed
that none wished him "God speed."</p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">Queen Mary proclaimed, 19 July.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No sooner was his back turned than the lords
of the council, seeing how matters were going, and
eager to throw off the yoke which the duke had
placed on their necks, determined upon proclaiming
Mary queen. It was necessary, however, that the
City should first be informed of their intention, and<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page455">[pg 455]</span><a name="Pg455" id="Pg455" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc254" id="toc254"></a>
that, too, without creating too much attention. One
of their number therefore took the opportunity of
the mayor riding abroad on Wednesday, the 19th
July, to accost him privately and bid him and the
sheriffs, and such of the aldermen as he could
get together at short notice, to meet the lords
of the council within an hour at the Earl of
Pembroke's place at Castle Baynard. The mayor
hurried back, sent for the Recorder and some of the
aldermen, and with them proceeded to the place
appointed, where they found the council assembled.
They were informed of the intention of the lords, and
the mayor was bidden to accompany them to Cheapside
for the purpose of proclaiming Queen Mary.
Their object soon got wind; a crowd followed them
to Cheapside, and when the proclamation was made
there was such a throwing up of caps and such cries
of "God save Queen Mary" that nothing else could be
heard. The civic authorities, as well as the lords of
the council, thereupon proceeded to St. Paul's to hear
a <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Te Deum</span></span>; after which the lords withdrew from the
city, leaving orders, however, for Queen Mary to be
proclaimed in other parts of the city according to
custom. The next day (20 July) they returned and
dined with the mayor, sitting in council, after dinner,
until four o'clock in the afternoon, whilst the church
bells rang all day long.<a id="noteref_1365" name="noteref_1365" href="#note_1365"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1365</span></span></a></p>

affairs had taken, he caused Mary to be proclaimed
at Cambridge, where he happened to be quartered,
"castinge up his capp after as if he had bene joyfull

him nothing, and orders were issued for his arrest.
Special precautions were taken to avoid disturbance
on the day (25 July) that he passed through the city
on his way to the Tower, every householder in the
several wards through which he and his fellow
prisoners were to pass being instructed to hold himself
in readiness within doors with a clean halberd, and a
bill or "pollox" for such service as the alderman
might appoint.<a id="noteref_1366" name="noteref_1366" href="#note_1366"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1366</span></span></a> No disturbance took place, the

The reception which the new queen met
with in the city must have been gratifying. The
mayor, on approaching her, handed to her the civic
sword, which was given to the Earl of Arundel to
carry before her. The mayor himself bore the mace.
By express permission of the Court of Aldermen a<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page457">[pg 457]</span><a name="Pg457" id="Pg457" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc255" id="toc255"></a>
number of Florentine and other merchant strangers
were allowed to attend on horseback, and to erect a
pageant at Leadenhall.<a id="noteref_1370" name="noteref_1370" href="#note_1370"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1370</span></span></a> The whole length of the
streets through which the queen had to pass on her
way to the Tower had been lavishly decorated, and
was lined with members of the various civic companies
in their livery gowns. Nothing was omitted that
could please the eye or ear.<a id="noteref_1371" name="noteref_1371" href="#note_1371"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1371</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A touching scene took place as Mary was about
to enter the Tower. The widow of the Duke of
Somerset, to whose policy as protector Mary had
offered a steady opposition, met the queen at the
Tower gate, and in company with the Duke of
Norfolk, Stephen Gardiner and others, who had been
confined in the Tower in the late reign, knelt down
and saluted her. Mary, in a charitable mood, kissed
each of them, claimed them as her own prisoners, and
shortly afterwards granted them their liberty.<a id="noteref_1372" name="noteref_1372" href="#note_1372"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1372</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A week later (10 Aug.) the remains of the late
king were carried from Whitehall to Westminster and
laid in Henry the Seventh's Chapel, the service
being conducted wholly in English, the communion
taking the place of the mass, and the priests being
vested in a surplice only, in accordance with the provisions
of the Book of Common Prayer. For a short
time after Mary's accession it was thought that she
would be content if the Church were restored to the
position it was in at the time when Henry VIII died.
It was not long before the new queen shewed this
opinion to be erroneous. The Prayer Book of King<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page458">[pg 458]</span><a name="Pg458" id="Pg458" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Edward VI was set aside, the high altars that had
been removed were restored, and mass was restored.
Ridley was sent to the Tower and Bonner brought out
from the Marshalsea and reinstated in the bishophric
of London. Gardiner, who had been deprived of his
see of Winchester and kept prisoner in the Tower, not
only recovered his freedom and his see, but was made
the queen's chancellor. On the other hand, Cranmer
and "Mr. Latimer" were sent to the Tower.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The change that was being wrought caused some
little disturbance in the city. When Doctor Bourne,
who had been put up by the queen to preach at
Paul's Cross one Sunday in August, began to pray for
the dead, and to refer to Bonner's late imprisonment,
one of his hearers threw a knife at him whilst others
called the preacher a liar. The queen was so angry
at this that she sent for the mayor and aldermen and
told them plainly that she would deprive the city
of its liberties if they could not better preserve peace
and good order within its walls.<a id="noteref_1373" name="noteref_1373" href="#note_1373"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1373</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A few days later she issued a proclamation in
which, whilst making no secret of her wish that
everyone would conform to the religion "which all
men knew she had of long tyme observed, and ment,
God willing, to contynue the same," she deprecated
men calling each other heretic or papist, but willed
that everyone should follow the religion he thought
best until further orders were taken.<a id="noteref_1374" name="noteref_1374" href="#note_1374"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1374</span></span></a> The mayor in

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lest any disturbance should arise on the following
Sunday (20 Aug.), when Bishop Gardiner's chaplain
was to preach at Paul's Cross, the queen sent the
captain of the guard with 200 men, who surrounded
the pulpit, halberd in hand. The mayor, too, had
ordered the livery companies to be present "to
herken yf any leude or sedicious persons made any
rumors"—a precaution which much pleased the
queen.<a id="noteref_1376" name="noteref_1376" href="#note_1376"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1376</span></span></a></p>

the queen passed through the city from the Tower
to Whitehall for her coronation. The streets presented
their usual gay appearance on this occasion,

she found her subjects in many points opposed to her.
They were willing to restore the worship and practice
of the Church as they existed before the death of
Henry VIII, but they showed a determination neither
to submit to Rome nor to restore to the Church the
property of which it had been deprived. They knew,
moreover, of her anxious wish to marry Philip, son of
the emperor Charles V, and yet did not hesitate to
present to her a petition against a foreign marriage.
It was a bold step for parliament to take in those
days, and showed that it was determined to win back
its ancient rights and no longer to be the tool of the
crown. Mary was not one likely to yield in a matter
on which she had once set her heart. Rather than
take its advice she dissolved parliament. The result
was an insurrection.</p>

youthful Lady Jane Grey—she "that wolde a been

brothers had been brought to trial at the Guildhall<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page461">[pg 461]</span><a name="Pg461" id="Pg461" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc257" id="toc257"></a>
(13 Nov). The axe was borne before them on their
way from the Tower, as if in anticipation of the
verdict. The Lady Jane is described as clad in a black
gown, with velvet cap and black hood, having a black
velvet book hanging at her girdle, whilst she carried
another in her hand.<a id="noteref_1381" name="noteref_1381" href="#note_1381"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1381</span></span></a> Each of the accused pleaded
guilty, and sentence of death was passed; its execution
was, however, delayed owing to the outbreak known
as Wyatt's Rebellion.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ostensible cause of the rebellion was the
queen's determination at all hazards to marry Philip,
whose ambassadors arrived at the opening of the new
year (1554). The civic authorities had been warned
to treat them handsomely, a warning which was
scarcely necessary, for the citizens have never allowed
political differences to interfere with their hospitality;
and accordingly one of the ambassadors was lodged
at Durham Place, near Charing Cross, another at the
Duke of Suffolk's house hard by, whilst a third
shared apartments with the chancellor "Nigro"
(Philip Negri) in Sir Richard Sackville's house at
the conduit in Fleet Street. To each and all of
the guests the City sent presents of wax, torches,
flour and every kind of meat, game and poultry.<a id="noteref_1382" name="noteref_1382" href="#note_1382"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1382</span></span></a>
Formal announcement of the intended match was
made by the chancellor on the 14th January, but
it was received with every sign of discontent and
misgiving, "yea and therat allmost eche man was<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page462">[pg 462]</span><a name="Pg462" id="Pg462" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

day on which the rebellion under Wyatt broke
out in Kent, to be followed by risings in Devonshire
and Norfolk—the mayor and aldermen were summoned
to court and ordered to bring with them forty
of the chief commoners of the city, when the lord
chancellor informed them of the queen's intention,
and exhorted them as obedient subjects to accept her
grace's pleasure and to remain content and quiet. He
warned them, at the same time, to see that the
queen's wishes respecting religious services in the city
were strictly carried out, on pain of incurring her high
indignation.<a id="noteref_1384" name="noteref_1384" href="#note_1384"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1384</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Steps were taken for putting the city into a proper
state of defence. The civic companies were ordered
to set watches as on similar critical occasions, and
no gunpowder, weapons or other munitions of war
were allowed to be sent out of the city. Chains were
set up at the bridge-foot and at the corner of New
Fish Street. The borough of Southwark was called
upon to provide eighty tall and able men, well
harnessed and weaponed, for the safeguard of the
queen's person and of the city,<a id="noteref_1385" name="noteref_1385" href="#note_1385"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1385</span></span></a> whilst the livery

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whatever faults Queen Mary had, she was by no
means deficient in courage. On the same day (1 Feb.)
that Wyatt appeared with his forces at Southwark,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page463">[pg 463]</span><a name="Pg463" id="Pg463" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc258" id="toc258"></a>
she came to the Guildhall<a id="noteref_1387" name="noteref_1387" href="#note_1387"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1387</span></span></a> and there addressed a
spirited harangue to the assembled citizens.<a id="noteref_1388" name="noteref_1388" href="#note_1388"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1388</span></span></a> She
plainly told them that her proposed marriage was but
a Spanish cloak to cover the real purpose of the
rebellion, which was aimed against her religion. She
was their queen, and they had sworn allegiance to
her; they surely would not allow her to fall into the
hands of so vile a traitor as Wyatt was. As for her
marriage, it had been arranged with the full knowledge
of the lords of the council, as one of expediency for
the realm. Passion had no part in the matter. She had
hitherto, she thanked God, lived a virgin, and doubted
not she could, if necessary, live so still. At the close
of her speech, which, we are told, was delivered in
a loud voice so that all might hear, she bade the
citizens to pluck up heart and not to fear the rebels
any more than she did. She then quitted the hall
and went up into the aldermen's council chamber and
there refreshed herself, after which she rode through
Bucklersbury to the Vintry, where she took barge to
Westminster.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime the Spanish ambassadors had
taken fright at Wyatt's approach and had "sped
themselves awaie by water, and that with all hast."<a id="noteref_1389" name="noteref_1389" href="#note_1389"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1389</span></span></a>
Many inhabitants of the city had also deserted their
fellow burgesses at this critical time, and their names
were submitted to the Court of Aldermen for subsequent
enquiry.<a id="noteref_1390" name="noteref_1390" href="#note_1390"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1390</span></span></a> They were, according to Foxe,
afraid of being entrapped by the queen and perhaps
put to death.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In response to the queen's speech the citizens at
once set to work to raise a force of 1,000 men for the
defence of the city, the mayor and aldermen each in
his own ward taking a muster. So busy was everyone
on Candlemas-day (2 Feb.) that the civic
authorities omitted to attend the afternoon service at
St. Paul's, and the mayor's serving-men waited upon
him at dinner ready harnessed.<a id="noteref_1391" name="noteref_1391" href="#note_1391"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1391</span></span></a> Even the lawyers

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The defensive precautions taken by the mayor
and aldermen were sufficient to prevent Wyatt making
good his entry into the city by Southwark and London
Bridge. Foiled in this direction he sought to approach
the city from another side, but had to march as far as
Kingston before he could cross the Thames. Many
of his followers in the meantime deserted him.<a id="noteref_1393" name="noteref_1393" href="#note_1393"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1393</span></span></a>
Nevertheless he continued to make his way, with
but little opposition, to Ludgate, which, contrary to
his expectation, he found shut in his face. He had
been recognised by a tailor of Watling Street, who
seeing the force approaching cried, "I know that theys
be Wyettes ancienttes," and forthwith closed the
gate.<a id="noteref_1394" name="noteref_1394" href="#note_1394"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1394</span></span></a> That Wyatt had supporters in the city may be
gathered from the half-hearted opposition that he met
with in Southwark, as well as from the fact that many
of the soldiers raised in the city and neighbourhood
deserted to Wyatt at the outset of the rebellion.<a id="noteref_1395" name="noteref_1395" href="#note_1395"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1395</span></span></a>
Wyatt himself exhibited no little disappointment
at finding Ludgate closed against him instead of the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page465">[pg 465]</span><a name="Pg465" id="Pg465" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc259" id="toc259"></a>
aid which he evidently had expected. "I have kept

He had scarcely reached Temple Bar before he was
overcome by a superior force and yielded himself a
prisoner. After a short stay at Whitehall he was
removed to the Tower.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The failure of the revolt was fatal to Lady
Jane Grey, and she was beheaded within the Tower
(12 Feb.) almost at the same time that her husband
was being executed outside on Tower Hill. By the
strange irony of fortune, it fell to the lot of Thomas
Offley to perform the duties of sheriff at Dudley's
execution, although he had himself been one of the
supporters of the Lady Jane in her claim to the crown.
For the next few days the city presented a sad
spectacle; whichever way one turned there was to be
seen a gibbet with its wretched burden, whilst the
city's gates bristled with human heads.<a id="noteref_1397" name="noteref_1397" href="#note_1397"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1397</span></span></a> Wyatt himself

in the late rebellion, the mayor was ordered
by Bishop Gardiner to bring up the originator of the

White appeared with the culprit, one Richard Cut by
name, a servant to a grocer in the city, he was soundly
rated by Gardiner for not having himself punished the
offender, and when he replied that the party was
there present for the Star Chamber to deal with
according to its pleasure, was again rebuked:—"My

the citizens for a sum of 6,000 marks. Thus called
upon to supply a rod for their own backs, the citizens
demurred. They at first proposed to offer the sum of
1,000 marks, or at the most £1,000; they afterwards
agreed to contribute double the first mentioned sum,<a id="noteref_1403" name="noteref_1403" href="#note_1403"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1403</span></span></a>
and this was accepted. The money was raised by
contributions from the different livery companies, the
Merchant Taylors, the Mercers, the Grocers, the
Drapers, the Fishmongers, the Goldsmiths, and the
Haberdashers being called upon to subscribe the sum
of £100 respectively, whilst the rest of the companies
paid sums varying from £80 to forty shillings.<a id="noteref_1404" name="noteref_1404" href="#note_1404"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1404</span></span></a> No
sooner had the citizens satisfied the queen in this
respect than they were called upon to send 200
soldiers to Gillingham, in Kent, there to be embarked
for foreign service under the Lord Admiral. The City
again demurred, and asked to be excused the necessity
of forwarding the men beyond Billingsgate or the
Tower Wharf and also of providing them with
accoutrements. It was to no purpose, both men and
accoutrements had to be found.<a id="noteref_1405" name="noteref_1405" href="#note_1405"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1405</span></span></a> On the 10th April

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That Wyatt still had friends in the city is shown
by the bold attitude taken up by the jury in the
trial (17 April) of one of his accomplices, Nicholas
Throckmorton, against whom they brought in a<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page468">[pg 468]</span><a name="Pg468" id="Pg468" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

over to appear before the Star Chamber. Four of the
twelve made submission; the rest, among whom were
Thomas Whetstone, a haberdasher, and Emanuel
Lucar, a merchant tailor, were committed some to
the Tower and the rest to the Fleet, where they
remained for six months. In the meantime the
Court of Aldermen wrote (19 July) to the council in
their favour, but with little success.<a id="noteref_1408" name="noteref_1408" href="#note_1408"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1408</span></span></a> A month later
(19 August) a deputation waited on the Court of
Aldermen for advice as to what future steps had
best be taken for obtaining the release of their
brethren in the Fleet, when they were told that the
wives of the prisoners or the prisoners' friends should
first make suit to the council for their release, after
which the court would see what they could do.<a id="noteref_1409" name="noteref_1409" href="#note_1409"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1409</span></span></a> At
length the prisoners were summoned once more
(26 Oct.) before the Star Chamber, when they one
and all declared that they had only acted in accordance
with their conscience, whilst Lucar, more outspoken
than the rest, asserted that "they had done in the
matter like honest men and true and faithful subjects."
Such plain speaking ill suited the judges, who thereupon
condemned the offenders to a fine of 1,000
marks apiece and imprisonment until further order.
Eventually five out of the eight were discharged
(12 December) on payment of a fine of £220, and ten
days later the rest regained their liberty on payment
of £60 apiece.<a id="noteref_1410" name="noteref_1410" href="#note_1410"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1410</span></span></a></p>

and on the 25th became his wife. It was not until
the 17th August that the royal pair approached
the city. On that day they came by water from Richmond
to Southwark, the king in one barge, the queen
in another. After taking refreshment at the Bishop

of Sunday the 19th August as the day. On the

a letter from the queen commending them for their

give strict orders to the members of their several
companies to honestly use and entreat the Spaniards
in all things, both at their coming in with the king
and queen and ever afterwards. The same morning
a speech which the Recorder had prepared for the
occasion in English was handed over to the master of
St. Paul's School to be turned into Latin. None too
much time was allowed the worthy pedagogue for

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A curious incident is related in connection with
the royal procession through the city. The conduit
in Gracious Church Street, which had been newly
painted and gilded, bore representations of the "nine
worthies," and among them Henry the Eighth and
Edward the Sixth. Instead of carrying a sword or
mace like the rest, Henry had been portrayed with a
sceptre in one hand and a book bearing the inscription
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Verbum Dei</span></span> in the other. This catching the eye of
Bishop Gardiner as he passed in the royal train, he
was very wroth and sent for the painter, asked him
by whose orders he had so depicted the king, called
him "traitor" and threatened him with the Fleet<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page471">[pg 471]</span><a name="Pg471" id="Pg471" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc262" id="toc262"></a>
prison. The poor painter, who for the first time had
been made to realise the change that was taking
place, pleaded that what he had done had been done
in all innocence, and hastened to rectify his mistake
by removing the bible from the picture and substituting
in its place a pair of gloves.<a id="noteref_1418" name="noteref_1418" href="#note_1418"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1418</span></span></a></p>

called, which proved more ready than the last to
comply with the queen's wishes. It re-enacted the
statutes for burning heretics and agreed to a reconciliation
of the Church of England with the See
of Rome, but it refused to sanction the surrender
of Church lands. Bonner had already taken steps
to purge his diocese of heresy by issuing a series
of articles (14 Sept.) to which every inhabitant,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nevertheless the attempt to restore the old
worship within the city was often met with scornful
mockery, sometimes attended with violence. A dead
cat, for instance, was one day found hanging in
Cheapside, its head shorn in imitation of a priest's
tonsure, and its body clothed in a mock ecclesiastical
vestment, with cross before and behind, whilst a piece
of white paper to represent a singing-cake was placed
between its forefeet, which had been tied together.
Bonner was very angry at this travesty of religion,
and caused the effigy to be publicly displayed at
Paul's Cross during sermon time. A reward of twenty
marks was offered for the discovery of this atrocious
act, but with what success we do not know.<a id="noteref_1427" name="noteref_1427" href="#note_1427"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1427</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On another occasion, when the Holy Sacrament
was being carried in solemn procession through
Smithfield on Corpus Christi-day (24 May), an attempt
was made to knock the holy elements out of the
hands of the priest. The offender was taken to<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page473">[pg 473]</span><a name="Pg473" id="Pg473" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc263" id="toc263"></a>

paid the penalty of his crime by being burned at the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By the opening of 1555 her own strong personal
will had overcome the conciliatory policy of her
husband, who was content to restrain his fanaticism
within the limits of expediency, and the Marian
persecution commenced. On the 25th January a
proclamation was issued in the name of the king and
queen, and bearing the signature of William Blackwell,
the town clerk of the city, enjoining the lighting of
bonfires that afternoon in various places in token of
great joy and gladness for the abolition of sundry
great sins, errors and heresies which lately had arisen
within the realm of England, and for the quiet renovation
and restitution of the true Catholic faith of Christ
and his holy religion.<a id="noteref_1432" name="noteref_1432" href="#note_1432"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1432</span></span></a> This proclamation was but a
prelude to other fires lighted for a very different
purpose, which the mind even at this day cannot
contemplate without a shudder. The first victim of
the flames for conscience sake was John Rogers, once<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page474">[pg 474]</span><a name="Pg474" id="Pg474" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
vicar of St. Sepulchre's church and prebendary of St.
Paul's. He was burnt in Smithfield "for gret herysy"
in February of this year, in which month Hooper,
who had been deprived of his bishopric of Gloucester,
suffered the same fate in his own cathedral city.<a id="noteref_1433" name="noteref_1433" href="#note_1433"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1433</span></span></a>
In the following May another city vicar, John Cardmaker,
otherwise known as John Taylor of St. Bride's,
who had been a reader at St. Paul's and had publicly
lectured against the real presence, was burnt in Smithfield
with John Warne, an "upholder" of Walbrook.<a id="noteref_1434" name="noteref_1434" href="#note_1434"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1434</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Few weeks passed without the fire claiming some
human victim either in London or the provinces.
On the 9th February Thomas Tomkins, a godly and
charitable weaver of Shoreditch, and William Hunter,
a young London apprentice, were with four others
condemned to the stake. The two named met their
fate in Smithfield, one on the 16th March and the
other on the 26th. The rest were removed into
Essex and there consigned to the flames, three of
them in March and one in the following June.<a id="noteref_1435" name="noteref_1435" href="#note_1435"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1435</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In October Bishops Latimer and Ridley were

Ridley, and play the man"—cried Latimer encouragingly
to his fellow sufferer—"we shall this day light
such a candle, by God's grace, in England as I trust
shall never be put out." In March of the following
year (1556) Cranmer, after some display of weakness,
suffered the same fate, on the same spot, and with no
less fortitude. And thus for two years more the fires
were kept alive in London and in the country; the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page475">[pg 475]</span><a name="Pg475" id="Pg475" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc264" id="toc264"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Throughout Mary's reign the strife between the
citizens and merchant strangers was renewed. She
had herself added to the evil by her marriage with
Philip, causing the city to be flooded with Spaniards,
who took up their abode in the halls of the civic

being sent to the several aldermen of the city on
the 27th September enjoining them to make a return

in their ward during the past nine or ten days, and
whence they came.<a id="noteref_1439" name="noteref_1439" href="#note_1439"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1439</span></span></a> The favour shown by the Crown

prejudice of the liberties of the city,<a id="noteref_1442" name="noteref_1442" href="#note_1442"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1442</span></span></a> and eventually
the privileges were revoked on the ground that the

by the citizens towards foreigners made
itself felt more particularly against that class of
foreigner which kept open school in the city for
teaching writing. Certain scriveners, freemen of the
city, made a complaint before the Court of Aldermen
against foreigners keeping writing-school within the
city and its liberties.<a id="noteref_1444" name="noteref_1444" href="#note_1444"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1444</span></span></a> The chamberlain's conduct of

first opportunity of quitting her side and crossed over
to the continent (4 Sept., 1555) on a visit to the
Emperor Charles. The abdication of the latter towards
the close of 1556 made Philip master of the
richest and most extensive dominions in Europe, and
his greatest wish at the time was to engage England
in the war which was kindled between Spain and

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The citizens of London at once began to take

the following month a large force crossed over

civic authorities by letter of the departure of her
"deerest lord and husband" to pursue the enemy in

be prepared to set out at a day's notice. The letter
contained a schedule of names of individuals to whom
the queen had made special application, and these

Recorder and one of the sheriffs to repair to the
queen's council "for the good and suer understandyng
of her majesty's pleasure" in the matter. The deputation
was further instructed to remind the lords of the
council not only of the ancient liberties and franchises
of the city on the point, but also of the city's lack of
power to furnish a number of men exceeding any it
had ever been called upon to furnish before.<a id="noteref_1458" name="noteref_1458" href="#note_1458"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1458</span></span></a> It was

At the opening of the new year (2 Jan., 1558)
the queen wrote to the corporation desiring to be at

On the 13th the queen wrote to say that a violent
storm, which had occurred on the night of the 10th
January, had so crippled the fleet that her forces
could not be conveyed across the channel; the
civic authorities were therefore to withhold sending
their force to the sea-coast until further orders, but
to keep the same in readiness to start at an hour's
notice.<a id="noteref_1467" name="noteref_1467" href="#note_1467"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1467</span></span></a> On the 19th January the citizens were
informed by letter that Philip's forces were on their
way to Flanders, under the Duke of Savoy, and that
the channel was being kept open by a fleet under
Don Luis Carvaial. One half of the force of 1,000
men, furnished with armour and weapons and coats of
white welted with green and red crosses, was to be
despatched to Dover by the end of the month, thence
to sail for Dunkirk for service under the Earl of
Rutland. The City was to take especial care that
the contingent should be chosen from the handsomest
and best picked men, and superior to those
last sent.<a id="noteref_1468" name="noteref_1468" href="#note_1468"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1468</span></span></a> The force mustered at the Leadenhall, the

The people were afraid of rendering Philip too powerful.
Disappointed both in her public and domestic

of her husband, and the hatred of her subjects."
The loss of Calais so much affected her that she
declared that the name of the town would be found
impressed upon her heart after death. On the
occasion of her funeral the City put in its customary
claim for black livery cloth, but more than one

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The main object which Elizabeth kept before her
eyes, from first to last, was the preservation of peace—peace
within the Church and without. Her natural
inclination was towards the more ornate ritual of the
Roman Church, but the necessity she was under of
gaining the support of the Protestants, whom even the
fires of Smithfield had failed to suppress, inspired
restraint. All her actions were marked with caution
and deliberation. From the day of her accession
religious persecution in its worst form ceased. Non-conformity
was no longer punished by death. Preachers
who took advantage of the lull which followed the
Marian persecution and resumed disputatious sermons,
as they did more especially in the city, were silenced
by royal proclamation,<a id="noteref_1483" name="noteref_1483" href="#note_1483"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1483</span></span></a> which ordered them to confine
themselves to reading the gospel and epistle for the

ceremony other than that already accepted until parliament
should ordain otherwise.</p>

other than that set out in the last Prayer Book of

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The success of Elizabeth's policy was unfortunately
marred by the excess of zeal displayed by
the reformers. More especially was this the case in
the city of London. Had the inhabitants bent their

cathedral church, shutting up gambling houses, and
stopping interludes and plays which made a jest of

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime the state of affairs with France
and Scotland demanded Elizabeth's attention. The
marriage of Mary Stuart with the Dauphin of France
had taken place in April, 1558, and the sudden death
of Henry II of France by an accident at a tournament
had soon afterwards raised her and her husband to
the throne. Mary now assumed the arms and style of
Queen of England, and the life-long quarrel between
her and Elizabeth was about to commence. By the
end of the year (1559) Mary had collected a sufficient
force at her back to render her mistress of Scotland.
In the following January a French fleet was ready
to set sail. Nevertheless Elizabeth refused to take
any active measures to meet the enemy and to prevent
them effecting a landing. On the 6th she caused
proclamation to be made for French subjects to be
allowed perfect freedom as in time of peace, but
English vessels were to be held in readiness "untill yt

of Fraunce do entende."<a id="noteref_1490" name="noteref_1490" href="#note_1490"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1490</span></span></a> Long after the appearance
of a French fleet off the coast of Scotland, and
when it had been driven to take refuge in Leith
harbour, Elizabeth still declared her intention of<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page489">[pg 489]</span><a name="Pg489" id="Pg489" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc273" id="toc273"></a>
keeping, if possible, on friendly terms with France if
only the "insolent titles and claims" of Francis and
Mary might cease and Scotland left in peace.<a id="noteref_1491" name="noteref_1491" href="#note_1491"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1491</span></span></a> With

the French were forced to surrender, and, by a treaty
signed at Edinburgh, agreed to leave Scotland and to
acknowledge Elizabeth's right to the English crown.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1561 Mary, who had declined to recognise the
treaty of Edinburgh from the first, returned to Scotland,
in spite of Elizabeth's prohibition, and soon succeeded
in drawing over many Protestants to her side. In the
following year an opportunity offered itself to Elizabeth
for striking a blow at her rival—not in Scotland,
but in France. A civil war had broken out between
the French Protestants—or Huguenots, as they were
called—and their Catholic fellow-subjects, and Elizabeth
promised (Sept., 1562) to assist the leaders of
the Huguenots on condition that Havre—or Newhaven,
as the place was then known—was surrendered
to her as security for the fulfilment of a promise to
surrender Calais. The queen (23 July, 1562) applied
by letter to the City of London for a force of 600 men
to be held in readiness to march at a moment's notice.
She had determined, the letter said, to put the sea
coast into a "fencible arraye of warre."<a id="noteref_1493" name="noteref_1493" href="#note_1493"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1493</span></span></a> The men<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page490">[pg 490]</span><a name="Pg490" id="Pg490" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1563 a peace was patched up, and the Catholics
and Huguenots united in demanding from Elizabeth
the restoration of Havre. The queen refused to
surrender the town, and again called upon the City of
London to furnish her with 1,000 men for the purpose
of enabling her to secure Havre, and to compel the
French to surrender Calais as promised.<a id="noteref_1496" name="noteref_1496" href="#note_1496"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1496</span></span></a> The Court
of Aldermen hesitated to raise so large a force, and

as they always were of the stranger within their gates,
availed themselves of a too literal interpretation of
a royal proclamation and seized all the Frenchmen
they could find in the city with all their belongings.
They even went so far as to attack the house of the
French ambassador, and would probably have gone<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page491">[pg 491]</span><a name="Pg491" id="Pg491" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc274" id="toc274"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 8th July the City was informed by letter

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The period of peace and tranquillity which
ensued enabled the citizens to bestow more attention
on their own affairs. Their cathedral stood in urgent
need of repairs. Its steeple had been struck by
lightning in 1561, and 3,000 marks had already been<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page493">[pg 493]</span><a name="Pg493" id="Pg493" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc275" id="toc275"></a>

City from the lord treasurer in 1565 for a sum of
£300 towards roofing one of the aisles of the
cathedral came as a surprise to the Court of Aldermen,
who caused enquiries to be made as to the
receipt and delivery of contributions already made,
and returned for answer that the City of London
had long ago delivered "all such mony as the

or paye towards the sayd work." His lordship
was desired "no further to charge or burden the sayd

upon for a further contribution two years later
(June, 1567), when negotiations were entered into
between the City, the Bishop of London and the
Dean and Chapter of Saint Paul's, which ended in the
Corporation agreeing to find forty foders of lead for
roofing the south aisle of the cathedral, and lending
a sum of £150 to the bishop and the dean and
chapter, on condition the latter granted a further lease
to the City of the manor of Finsbury for a term of
200 years beyond the term yet unexpired.<a id="noteref_1513" name="noteref_1513" href="#note_1513"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1513</span></span></a> Whilst
repairs were being carried out in the cathedral itself,
something was also being done outside the building
to render the accommodation for hearing the sermons
preached at Paul's Cross more convenient for the
mayor and aldermen and municipal officers. A gutter<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page494">[pg 494]</span><a name="Pg494" id="Pg494" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The rapid increase of commerce under the
fostering care of Elizabeth rendered the erection of
a Burse or Exchange for the accommodation of
merchants "to treate of their feate of merchandyzes"
a pressing necessity. The matter had been mooted
thirty years before, but little had been done beyond
ascertaining the opinion of merchants as to the most
convenient site.<a id="noteref_1515" name="noteref_1515" href="#note_1515"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1515</span></span></a> The project, however, took root in
the mind of Sir Richard Gresham, an alderman of the
city, whose business had occasionally carried him to
Antwerp, where he became familiar with the Burse
that had been recently set up there, and in 1537 (the
year that he was elected mayor) he forwarded to
Thomas Cromwell, then lord privy seal, a design for
a similar Burse to be erected in London. Finding
little or no attention paid to his communication he
again (25 July, 1538) wrote to Cromwell suggesting
the erection of a Burse in Lombard Street—the site
favoured by city merchants—at a cost of £2,000. If
the lord privy seal would but bring pressure to bear
upon Sir George Monoux, a brother alderman but a
man of "noe gentyll nature," to part with certain
property at cost price, he (Gresham) would undertake<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page495">[pg 495]</span><a name="Pg495" id="Pg495" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc276" id="toc276"></a>
to raise £1,000 towards the building before he went
out of office, and he would himself carry Cromwell's
letter to Monoux and "handle him" as best he
could.<a id="noteref_1516" name="noteref_1516" href="#note_1516"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1516</span></span></a> This application had the desired effect. On
the 13th August Henry VIII addressed a letter to
Monoux desiring him to dispose of certain tenements
about Lombard Street which were required for the
commonweal of merchants of the city, and to come
to terms with Gresham as to the amount to be paid
for them. Both parties having referred the matter
to Sir Richard Rich, Chancellor of the Court of
Augmentations of the Crown, as arbitrator, the City
agreed to pay a yearly sum of twenty marks for the
houses that were required. Monoux refusing to accept
this sum, another letter was despatched to him from
the king urging him not to stand in the way of a
project so useful to merchants and tending so much
to the "beautifitye" of the city. To this second
appeal Monoux gave way, and received the cordial
thanks of Henry by letter dated the 25th November.<a id="noteref_1517" name="noteref_1517" href="#note_1517"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1517</span></span></a>
Nothing more was done in the matter until it was
taken up many years later by Sir Thomas Gresham,
son of Sir Richard.<a id="noteref_1518" name="noteref_1518" href="#note_1518"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1518</span></span></a> Acting, as he did for a long
succession of years, as Queen Elizabeth's agent in
Flanders, Sir Thomas spent much of his time in
Antwerp.<a id="noteref_1519" name="noteref_1519" href="#note_1519"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1519</span></span></a> When he was not there himself he<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page496">[pg 496]</span><a name="Pg496" id="Pg496" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
employed a factor in the person of Richard Clough to
conduct his affairs. In 1561 this Richard Clough, in
a letter addressed to his principal from Antwerp
(31 Dec.),<a id="noteref_1520" name="noteref_1520" href="#note_1520"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1520</span></span></a> expressed much astonishment at the City
of London being so far behind continental towns:—"Consideryng
what a sittey London ys, and that in
so many yeres they have nott founde the menes to
make a bourse! but must walke in the raine, when
ytt raineth, more lyker pedlers then marchants; and
in thys countrie, and all other, there is no kynde
of pepell that have occasion to meete, butt they
have a plase meete for that pourpose." Indeed,
Clough got quite excited over the thought that
London, of all cities in the world, possessed no decent
accommodation for merchants transacting their everyday
business, and declared his readiness to build "so
fere a bourse in London as the grett bourse is in
Andwarpe" and that "withhoutt molestyng of any
man more than he shulld be well dysposyd to geve."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was not long before Gresham made up his
mind that London should have a Burse, and in May,
1563, the Court of Aldermen deputed Lionel Duckett,
who was also a mercer, to sound Gresham as to "his
benevolence towards the makyng of a burse."<a id="noteref_1521" name="noteref_1521" href="#note_1521"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1521</span></span></a> But
however desirous Gresham might be to prosecute the
work, he was prevented from doing so by stress
of business. Commercial difficulties arose between
England and the Low Countries owing to the proclamation
of the Duchess of Parma. Up to the year
1564 Gresham was forced to make Antwerp his place
of abode, and could only occasionally visit London;<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page497">[pg 497]</span><a name="Pg497" id="Pg497" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc277" id="toc277"></a>
since that time, however, his business allowed him
to look upon London as his permanent residence, and
he only crossed over to Antwerp when special circumstances
rendered it necessary. An additional
reason for the delay in carrying out Gresham's project
may perhaps be found in the fact that, during his
absence on the queen's business in 1563, Elizabeth
had, with her usual parsimony, cut down Gresham's
allowance of twenty shillings a day for "his diets."
Gresham complained bitterly of this abridgment of his
income in a letter to Secretary Cecil, and also in another
letter couched in more guarded terms to the queen
herself.<a id="noteref_1522" name="noteref_1522" href="#note_1522"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1522</span></span></a> In both letters he set out the sum total of
the money (£830,000) which he had negotiated for
the queen, and referred to his having broken a leg in
her majesty's service and to his declining years. Whatever
may have been the cause of the delay, it was
not until the 4th January, 1565, that a definite offer
was made by Gresham to erect a "comely burse" at
his own cost and charge, provided the City would
furnish a suitable site. This offer was accepted.<a id="noteref_1523" name="noteref_1523" href="#note_1523"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1523</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is curious to note the strong foreign element
in connection with the building of Gresham's Burse.
The architect as well as the design of the building came
from abroad. The clerk of the works (Henryk)<a id="noteref_1529" name="noteref_1529" href="#note_1529"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1529</span></span></a>
and most of the workmen were foreigners, Gresham
having obtained special permission from the Court of
Aldermen for their employment.<a id="noteref_1530" name="noteref_1530" href="#note_1530"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1530</span></span></a> Most of the
material for structural as well as ornamental purposes
(saving 100,000 bricks provided by the City)<a id="noteref_1531" name="noteref_1531" href="#note_1531"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1531</span></span></a> came
from abroad, and to this day the Royal Exchange is
paved with small blocks of Turkish hone-stones believed
to have been imported in Gresham's day, and
to have been relaid after the several fires of 1666
and 1838. It was the employment of these strangers
which probably gave rise to an order of the Court of
Aldermen (19 June, 1567) that an officer should be
appointed to attend at the Burse daily "for a competent
season," to see that no "misorder" be done
to any of the artificers or other workmen there<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page499">[pg 499]</span><a name="Pg499" id="Pg499" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc278" id="toc278"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By the 22nd December, 1568, the Burse was so
far complete as to allow of merchants holding their
meetings within its walls, but it was not until the
23rd January, 1571, that the queen herself visited it
in state and caused it thenceforth to be called the
Royal Exchange. Her statue which graced the
building bore testimony to the care and interest she
always displayed in fostering commercial enterprise.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the door of a staircase leading up to a "pawne"
or covered walk on the south side of the building
there had been set up the arms and crest of Gresham
himself, which some evilly disposed person took it
into his head to deface. A proclamation made by
the mayor (16 Feb., 1569) for the apprehension of the
culprit does not appear from the city's records to
have proved successful.<a id="noteref_1533" name="noteref_1533" href="#note_1533"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1533</span></span></a> Some years later (21 March,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In 1574 the Court of Aldermen appointed a
committee to confer with Gresham touching the
"assurance" of the Royal Exchange.<a id="noteref_1535" name="noteref_1535" href="#note_1535"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1535</span></span></a> The connection
between the new Burse and insurance is
remarkable. The principle of insurance policies had<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page500">[pg 500]</span><a name="Pg500" id="Pg500" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
been introduced into the city by the Lombards as early
as the thirteenth century,<a id="noteref_1536" name="noteref_1536" href="#note_1536"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1536</span></span></a> and a Lombard Street
policy became a familiar term.<a id="noteref_1537" name="noteref_1537" href="#note_1537"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1537</span></span></a> When the Lombard
Street merchants quitted their old premises for the
more commodious Exchange they carried thither their
insurance business with them, and a part of the new
building was devoted exclusively to this branch of
commerce. A grant of letters patent which Elizabeth
made to Richard Candler for the making of policies
and registering of assurances within the city was
objected to by the Court of Aldermen, as being contrary
to the liberties of the City, and a deputation
was appointed to wait upon the lords of the Privy
Council to have it revoked.<a id="noteref_1538" name="noteref_1538" href="#note_1538"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1538</span></span></a> This was early in 1575.
A year later we find Candler making answer to a bill
of fees drawn up by certain aldermen and citizens of
London, respecting his office.<a id="noteref_1539" name="noteref_1539" href="#note_1539"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1539</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In order to put an end to the frequent disputes
which arose in the Royal Exchange among merchants
on matters of insurance, the Court of Aldermen
appointed two of their number to consider the difficulty
and to report thereon. They made their report
to the court on the 29th January, 1577.<a id="noteref_1540" name="noteref_1540" href="#note_1540"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1540</span></span></a> They had,

to previous lord mayors by the lords of the Privy
Council, consulted with their brethren the aldermen,
as well as with merchants of the city, both Englishmen
and foreigners, and had drawn up orders agreeable
to those that had hitherto been used in Lombard
Street, to which all countries had been accustomed to
submit. The orders, however, not yet being completed,
the Court of Aldermen decided upon appointing
arbitrators from year to year to deal with all matters
of insurance, and so relieve the lords of the Privy
Council of the trouble which they had hitherto
experienced on that score at a time when they had
weightier matters to attend to. The arbitrators were
to receive one penny in the pound amongst them in all
cases, whether the claim were for whole losses, part,<a id="noteref_1541" name="noteref_1541" href="#note_1541"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1541</span></span></a>
or averages. Their decision was to bind both assurer
and assured, and they were to sit twice a week
(Monday and Thursday) "in the offyce howse of
assurances" in the Royal Exchange. They were to
be attended by the "register of assurances," whose
business it was to summon witnesses. A poor-box
was to be provided, to which the party assured, on
judgment, should contribute twelve pence.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On Sundays and holy days the Exchange was
enlivened during a portion of the year with the music
of the city waits, who were ordered by the Court of
Aldermen (April, 1572) to play on their instruments
as they had hitherto been accustomed at the Royal
Exchange, from seven o'clock till eight o'clock in the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page502">[pg 502]</span><a name="Pg502" id="Pg502" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

is another circumstance connected with the same
building that deserves a passing notice, which is that
football used to be played within its walls, a game
forbidden in 1576 to be played any longer either there
or in any of the city's wards.<a id="noteref_1543" name="noteref_1543" href="#note_1543"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1543</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The citizens of London are indebted to Sir
Thomas Gresham for something more than their
Royal Exchange. By will dated 5th July, 1575,
proved and enrolled in the Court of Husting,<a id="noteref_1544" name="noteref_1544" href="#note_1544"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1544</span></span></a>
Gresham disposed of the reversion of the Royal
Exchange and of his mansion-house in the parish of
St. Helen, Bishopsgate, after the decease of his wife,
to the mayor and corporation of the city and to the
wardens and commonalty of the Mercers' Company in
equal moieties in trust (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">inter alia</span></span>) for the maintenance
of seven lectures on the several subjects of Divinity,
Astronomy, Music, Geometry, Law, Physic and
Rhetoric. In 1596 these two corporate bodies came
into possession of the property, and in the following
year drew up ordinances for the regulation of the
various lectures. According to the terms of Gresham's
will the lectures were delivered at Gresham House.
When Gresham House, which escaped the Fire of
London, became dilapidated, the City and the
Company on more than one occasion petitioned
Parliament for leave to pull it down and to erect
another building on its site. The proposal, however,
was not entertained, but in the year 1767 an Act was<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page503">[pg 503]</span><a name="Pg503" id="Pg503" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc280" id="toc280"></a>
passed vesting Gresham House in the Crown for the
purpose of an Excise Office, and providing for the
payment by the Crown to the City and Company of
a perpetual annuity of £500 per annum. For some
time the lectures ceased to be delivered for lack of
accommodation. When they were next delivered it
was at the City of London School, where they continued
until Gresham College was erected in Basinghall
Street.<a id="noteref_1545" name="noteref_1545" href="#note_1545"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1545</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime Protestantism had been gaining
ground in England as well as on the continent.
Many who in the evil days of the Marian persecution
had sought refuge in Switzerland and Germany had
returned to England as soon as they were assured of
safety under Elizabeth, and had introduced into the
country the religious tenets of Calvin they had learnt
abroad. Elizabeth found herself confronted not only
by Catholics but by Puritans. As she felt herself
seated more strongly on the throne she determined
to enforce more strictly than hitherto the Act of
Uniformity. In 1565 the London clergy were ordered
to wear the surplice and to conform in other particulars.
Between thirty and forty of them—and those
the most intelligent and active of them—refused and
resigned their cures. Their congregations supported
them, and thus a large body of good Protestants were
driven into opposition. But there all action against
them ceased. It was otherwise with the Protestants
on the continent, where a determination arrived at in
the same year that Elizabeth enforced the Act of Uniformity,
to suppress heresy, led to the most horrible<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page504">[pg 504]</span><a name="Pg504" id="Pg504" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
persecution, and drove many of the inhabitants to
seek refuge in England.</p>

the brother of the great Coligny, the Cardinal
Chastillon. The Bishop of London having excused
himself entertaining the cardinal at Fulham, his
eminence was lodged and hospitably treated for a
whole week by Gresham. During his visit he paid a
visit, Huguenot as he was, to the French Church
established in the city, where his co-religionists were
allowed to worship without fear of molestation. He
further paid his host the compliment of visiting the
Exchange, then approaching completion. At the end
of the week he removed to Sion House, where
accommodation had been found for him.<a id="noteref_1547" name="noteref_1547" href="#note_1547"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1547</span></span></a></p>

factor, to raise what money she required by loans from
merchants abroad. Merchant strangers were well
content to lend her money at ten or twelve per cent.,
seeing that the City of London was as often as not
called upon to give bonds for repayment by way of
collateral security.<a id="noteref_1556" name="noteref_1556" href="#note_1556"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1556</span></span></a> When that door was closed to
her she turned to her own subjects, the Company of
Merchant Adventurers, to whom she had shown considerable
favour. Her first application to this company
for a loan was, to her great surprise, refused. The
matter was afterwards accommodated through the
intervention of Sir Thomas Gresham; and as the
confidence of the city merchants increased, loans were
afterwards frequently negotiated between them and
the Crown, much to the convenience of one party and
to the advantage of the other.<a id="noteref_1557" name="noteref_1557" href="#note_1557"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1557</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As another means of raising money Elizabeth had
resort to a lottery—the first public lottery ever held

not unknown in the city in the reign of Henry VIII.<a id="noteref_1558" name="noteref_1558" href="#note_1558"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1558</span></span></a>
The lottery was advertised in 1567 as being a very
rich lottery general, without any blanks, containing a
number of good prizes of ready-money, plate and
divers sorts of merchandise, the same having been
valued by expert and skilful men. The lottery was,
as we should say at the present day, "under the
immediate patronage" of the queen herself, and the
proceeds, after deducting expenses, were to be devoted
to the repair of harbours and other public works conducive
to strengthening the realm. Besides the prizes, of<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page507">[pg 507]</span><a name="Pg507" id="Pg507" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc282" id="toc282"></a>
which a long list is set out in the city's records, there
were to be three "welcomes" or bonuses given to the
first three winners of lots. The first person to whom
a lot should happen to fall was to have for "welcome"
a piece of silver-gilt plate of the value of £50, and
the second and third fortunate drawers were to have
respectively, in addition to their prizes, a piece of gilt
plate of the value of £20. The prizes, the chief of
which amounted to £5,000 sterling, although the
winner was to receive only £3,000 in cash, the rest
being taken out in plate and tapestry,<a id="noteref_1559" name="noteref_1559" href="#note_1559"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1559</span></span></a> were exhibited

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before the close of 1568 Alva had severed the
last links connecting England with the Low Countries
by suddenly seizing and imprisoning all English merchants
found at Antwerp on the ground that certain
Spanish treasure-ships had been detained in England.
Such conduct on his part was characterized by
Elizabeth as "verie straunge and hertofore in no tyme
used betwixt the Crowne of England and the House
of Burgondye w<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">t</span></span> owt some manner of former conferrence
proceedyng and intelligence had of the
myndes and intentions of the prynces themselves
on both sides," and she forthwith issued a proclamation
for the seizure of Spanish vessels and
merchants found in English ports by way of reprisal.<a id="noteref_1567" name="noteref_1567" href="#note_1567"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1567</span></span></a>
She was careful to show that any former detention of
Spanish vessels served as a mere pretence for Alva's
conduct. Certain Spanish vessels of small tonnage,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page509">[pg 509]</span><a name="Pg509" id="Pg509" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc283" id="toc283"></a>
called "zabras," had, it was true, entered English
harbours in the west country, and the bullion and
merchandise had been discharged on English soil; but
all this had been done in order to prevent the ships
and cargo falling into the hands of the French ships
which threatened them. Some of the treasure had
been even "borrowed"; but this was not contrary to
the honorable usage of princes in their own dominions.
The Spanish ambassador had called upon her majesty
to ask that the vessels and cargo might be given up,
"pretending the monye to appertaine to the king his
maister," which her majesty had declared her willingness
to assent to as soon as she should have had
communication from the west country. The ambassador,
who was asked to return in four or five
days to receive the ships and treasure, had failed to
appear, and her surprise was great to find that orders
had been given for the arrest of her subjects at
Antwerp on the very day (29 Oct.) that the Spanish
ambassador was with her majesty. Such was the
account of the matter as given in the queen's proclamation
to the citizens of London. But there are
other and contradictory accounts. Whoever may
have been the rightful owner of the treasure, which
in all probability was on its way to Flanders for
payment of Alva's soldiers,<a id="noteref_1568" name="noteref_1568" href="#note_1568"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1568</span></span></a> the opportunity of
dealing a blow to Spain and at the same time of

presence of the ships in English waters was thought
too good to be lost.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 5th January the mayor received orders
from Sir Nicholas Bacon to seize all Flemings' goods
to the queen's use, inasmuch as it was quite possible
that what had taken place in Flanders had been
done without the King of Spain's commission. The

happened to be a connection by marriage of Sir

daughter of Sir John Gresham, of Titsey, Sir Thomas's

mayor received information of Alva's arbitrary proceedings
before the news reached the ears of Secretary
Cecil; for Gresham's factor at Antwerp, Richard
Clough, had lost no time in despatching a special
messenger to his master, who, immediately after
hearing the news, broke in upon the mayor's slumbers
at twelve o'clock on the night of the 3rd January in
order to communicate the same to him. The next

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That such a large amount of treasure should be
lying idle did not commend itself to the mind of so
astute a financier as Sir Thomas Gresham. He
accordingly suggested to Sir William Cecil by letter
(14 Aug., 1569) that the queen should cause it to be
minted into her own coin, and thereby make a profit
of £3,000 or £4,000. As for repayment, her majesty
could effect it by way of exchange, to her great profit,
or give bonds for a year or more to the merchants
who owned the money, and who, in Gresham's opinion,
would willingly accede to such proposal.<a id="noteref_1577" name="noteref_1577" href="#note_1577"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1577</span></span></a> Bold as

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By proclamation made the last day of June, 1570,
English merchants who had suffered loss by Alva's

loss to the officers of one or other of the cities or
towns of London, Southampton, Bristol, Chester,
Newcastle, Hull or Ipswich, as they should find it
most convenient,<a id="noteref_1580" name="noteref_1580" href="#note_1580"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1580</span></span></a> and on the 20th July following

authority to arrange matters, whilst at the same time
they wished to introduce clauses and conditions
which Elizabeth could in no wise accept. Seeing
that she was being played with, and knowing that
much of the goods of English merchants seized in
Spain and the Netherlands had already been sold, the
queen determined to put up for sale the Spanish
merchandise which for three years had been in
English hands. Proclamation to this effect was made
the 14th January, 1572.<a id="noteref_1583" name="noteref_1583" href="#note_1583"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1583</span></span></a> The queen showed every
desire to treat the Spanish merchants with consideration.
The sale was entrusted to Spanish
subjects, who, upon their oath, were to make sale of
all the ships, goods, wares and merchandise arrested,
to the utmost advantage they could; and Spanish
owners were allowed, either by themselves, their
factor or attorney, freely to enter the realm within
thirty days after the date of the proclamation to
attend the sale, provided they made no attempt
against her majesty or the peace of the country and
departed immediately the sale was over. This
proclamation, coupled with the hopelessness of Alva's
case and the manifestation of discontent displayed by
his own ruined merchants, led to articles being drawn
up (25 Mar.) between Elizabeth and the King of
Spain for an adjustment of their respective claims.
Sir Thomas Gresham had previously (4 Feb.) been
directed by letter from Lord Burghley and Sir Walter
Mildmay to deliver up certain bonds of the Governor
and Company of Merchant Adventurers to be cancelled

been deposed from the throne of Scotland and had
sought shelter in England, was importuning her for
assistance for the recovery of her lost crown. Whilst
Elizabeth hesitated either to replace her rival in power
or to set her at liberty, the Earls of Northumberland
and Westmoreland endeavoured to carry out a scheme
for marrying Mary to the Duke of Norfolk and forcing
Elizabeth to acknowledge her as successor to the
crown of England. The Duke of Norfolk obeyed
the queen's summons to attend the court, and was
committed to the Tower (Oct., 1569).<a id="noteref_1585" name="noteref_1585" href="#note_1585"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1585</span></span></a> The earls

Troops were sent against them, but they cowardly
left their supporters to their own fate and fled to

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So long as the Spanish king turned a deaf ear to
the exhortations of the Pope, and refused to make a
descent upon England, Elizabeth was able to cope
with Catholicism at home by peaceful measures. But
the time was approaching when she could no longer
refuse to give practical assistance to her struggling
co-religionists on the continent. The Netherlands
had for some time past been preparing for open revolt
against the barbarous government of Alva. In 1572 a
party seized Brill, and thus laid the foundation of the
Dutch Republic. It wanted but the active adhesion of
Elizabeth to enable the French to drive the Spaniards
out of the country, but this the queen was as yet unwilling
to give. Two years later (1574) she offered
her services to effect an understanding between Spain
and the Netherlands, but her mediation proved futile.
Both in 1572 and 1574 there are signs of military

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the following year Casimir, Count Palatine
of the Rhine, paid a visit to England to answer a
charge brought against him by the English envoy in
Holland, of having used forces against the Netherlanders
which had been despatched from these shores
for their support. On the evening of Thursday, the
22nd January, 1579, the Count landed at the Tower,
where he was received by a party of noblemen and
others, among whom we may conjecture was the
Mayor of London and representatives of the city.<a id="noteref_1611" name="noteref_1611" href="#note_1611"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1611</span></span></a>
Thence he was conducted by the light of cressets to
Gresham's house, in Bishopsgate Street, where he was
received with music and lodged and feasted by the
worthy owner for three days. The honour thus
shown to Gresham is only one more proof of the
esteem and respect in which he was universally held
by all parties, and, "in truth," as his biographer
justly remarks,<a id="noteref_1612" name="noteref_1612" href="#note_1612"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1612</span></span></a> "his great experience, his long and<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page521">[pg 521]</span><a name="Pg521" id="Pg521" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc289" id="toc289"></a>
familiar intercourse with men of all grades and professions,
from princes and nobles—with whom ...
he was on as intimate a footing as the impassable
barrier of rank will permit—to the lowliest of his
own dependants, the knowledge of men and manners
which he must have derived from foreign travel, and
his acquaintance with all the languages of civilised
Europe, must have rendered him, towards the close
of his life especially, as favourable a specimen as
could have been selected of the English gentleman
of that day." Casimir's reception was one of the
last acts of public service performed by Gresham, for
before the close of the year he had died (21 Nov.).
On Sunday (25 Jan.) the Count was conducted to
Westminster for an interview with the queen, after
which lodgings were assigned to him in Somerset
House. The court of Common Council had already
(23 Jan.) voted "Duke Cassimerus" a gratification
"in moneye or anye other thinge" to the value of
500 marks.<a id="noteref_1613" name="noteref_1613" href="#note_1613"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1613</span></span></a> His visit was one round of feasting,
hunting and sight-seeing; one day dining with the
lord mayor, another with the merchants of the
Steelyard; one day hunting at Hampton Court, and
another day witnessing athletic sports at Westminster.
That the Count succeeded in clearing his character
may be surmised from the fact of his receiving the
Order of the Garter before his departure.<a id="noteref_1614" name="noteref_1614" href="#note_1614"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1614</span></span></a></p>

(June, 1580). A twelvemonth later it was raging in<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page522">[pg 522]</span><a name="Pg522" id="Pg522" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
London, but as the weather grew colder its virulence
abated, allowing of the resumption of the lord mayor's
feast. The respite was short. In the spring of 1582
it was again rife in the city, increasing in fatality
during the hot season and continuing until the winter
of 1583.<a id="noteref_1615" name="noteref_1615" href="#note_1615"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1615</span></span></a> Business was often at a standstill, the law

ground to no less than twenty-three city parishes,
became overcrowded and greatly added to the insanitary
condition of the city by its shallow graves.
The mayor informed the lords of the council of this
state of affairs by letter (15 May, 1582), in which he
says that scarcely any grave was then made without
exposing corpses, and that the heat of the crowds
standing over the shallow graves caused noxious exhalations.
It was currently reported at the time that
the gravediggers were the cause of the shallow graves
"as being desirous to have the infection spred that
they might gaine by burieng."<a id="noteref_1617" name="noteref_1617" href="#note_1617"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1617</span></span></a></p>

would find herself unable any longer to maintain her
frequent cry to the council board, "No war, my lords,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There were two ways in which the Pope and
Spain could attack England, the one by making a
descent upon the coast, the other by undermining
the loyalty of the queen's subjects by the aid of missionaries.
A descent upon the English coast was, for
the present at least, out of the question, but it was
possible to wound England by fostering insurrection
in Ireland. Accordingly, in 1579, a large force landed
at Limerick under the authority of the Pope. It
was, however, overpowered and destroyed by Lord
Grey, the lord deputy.<a id="noteref_1618" name="noteref_1618" href="#note_1618"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1618</span></span></a></p>

a force of 800 men from Spain, with the connivance,
if not with the authority, of Philip. When the

England, and the city became their chief refuge.<a id="noteref_1620" name="noteref_1620" href="#note_1620"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1620</span></span></a> A

object in Ireland, the Catholics resorted to intrigue to
gain the same object in England and Scotland. For
some years past there had been a steady flow from
the continent of seminary priests, who worked silently
and secretly making converts to the old religion.
Every precaution was taken to prevent their inculcating
their dangerous opinions into the minds of the
inhabitants of the city and drawing them off from
their allegiance to the queen and to the established
Church. The aldermen were instructed to make
return of those in their ward who refused to attend<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page525">[pg 525]</span><a name="Pg525" id="Pg525" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc293" id="toc293"></a>

stranger was called upon to subscribe the Articles of
religion before he was allowed to take up his residence
within the city, and those who refused to subscribe
or to attend church were to give bond for their
appearance before her Majesty's Commissioners for
Ecclesiastical Causes to answer such matters as should
be objected against them.<a id="noteref_1625" name="noteref_1625" href="#note_1625"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1625</span></span></a> The aldermen were

under two priests, Campion and Parsons, was despatched
to England as part of an organised Catholic
scheme. Campion had at one time been a fellow
of St. John's College, Oxford. Their first step was
to remove a difficulty under which devout Catholics
had laboured ever since the issue of the Bull of
excommunication against Elizabeth in 1571. That
Bull had reduced them to the necessity of choosing
between disobedience to the Church and treason to
the queen. The new missionaries helped them out
of the dilemma by explaining that the censures of the
Church only applied to heretics; Catholics might
feign allegiance and the Church would say nothing.</p>

measures—A proclamation was issued requiring

fines upon all who refused to attend the service of
the established Church, in addition to the penalties
imposed in 1571 upon those who claimed to absolve
subjects from their allegiance and to receive them into
the Church of Rome. In the city a strict watch was
again ordered to be kept on all those who failed to
attend regularly their parish church.<a id="noteref_1628" name="noteref_1628" href="#note_1628"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1628</span></span></a> It was further

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These instructions Bishop Aylmer forwarded to
the lord mayor with a request for a contribution to
enable him and his associates, the dean of St. Paul's
and the dean of Windsor, to carry them into effect.
The mayor replied (6 Sept., 1581) that, as for himself,
his office was already so burdensome, both in work
and expense, that it would go hard with him if
he was called upon to pay more than any other
parishioner in a Church matter. Both he and his
brethren the aldermen were no less desirous than others
to promote the knowledge of true religion and to inculcate
obedience to the queen by lectures in the city,
but the commons would have to be consulted first. He
enclosed a list of lectures already established in the
several parishes, and drew attention to the great
yearly charge incurred by the companies and private<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page527">[pg 527]</span><a name="Pg527" id="Pg527" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc294" id="toc294"></a>

universities to serve the Church in the office of

said, warranted the City and the Companies asking
to be no further burdened. The writer concluded
by intimating that, however willing the corporation
might be to assist in the good work, its ability to
do so had been much diminished by the indiscreet
demeanour of the bishop's own chaplain, Mr. Dyos,
who had recently defamed the citizens in a public
sermon at Paul's Cross, "as favorers of userers, of the
familye of love and puritanes," saying "that if the
appointing of preachers were committed to us we
wold appointe preachers such as should defend
usirie, the familie of love and puritanisme as they
call it." The City was liable to make mistakes, just
as the bishop himself had made a mistake in appointing
so indiscreet a person for his chaplain, but in other
respects they had no cause to reproach themselves
in the matter of appointments. In conclusion they
desired his lordship to take order for the reparation
of their good fame.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hitherto the City had received no direct communications
from the Privy Council on the subject,
but three days after the date of the lord mayor's
letter to the Bishop of London the lords of the
council made a direct appeal to the mayor and
aldermen suggesting that a collection should be
made among the clergy and other inhabitants of
the city in order to "oppose the supersticion of<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page528">[pg 528]</span><a name="Pg528" id="Pg528" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In April (1584) the City received orders to muster
4,000 men and to revive the military shows on the
eve of the Feasts of St. John the Baptist and St. Peter
the Apostle as accustomed to be held in the days of
Henry VIII. These displays had gradually fallen into
desuetude; it was now the queen's policy to renew
them.<a id="noteref_1635" name="noteref_1635" href="#note_1635"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1635</span></span></a> The citizens showed themselves equal to the
emergency, and "mustered and skirmished" daily at
Mile End and St. George's Field, so that in little more
than a month they were in a fit state of discipline and
training to appear in Greenwich Park before the queen
herself, who thanked them graciously for their energy

ready to suppress disloyalty and to defend her person.<a id="noteref_1636" name="noteref_1636" href="#note_1636"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1636</span></span></a></p>

that those who plotted against his life were plotting
also against the life of their queen, and with wonderful
unanimity—Catholics and Protestants alike—they<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page530">[pg 530]</span><a name="Pg530" id="Pg530" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
joined in a "Bond of Association" for the defence of

leader, the Netherlanders despatched envoys the

Elizabeth as their sovereign. Upon their

June were received in audience by the queen at
Greenwich. After much hesitation, as was her wont,
she at last consented to take the Netherlands under

but only on condition that the States gave

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Every effort was made to save Antwerp, but it
was too late. By chaffering and bargaining with the
envoys Elizabeth had lost her opportunity and
Antwerp fell (19 Aug.). She could be resolute at<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page531">[pg 531]</span><a name="Pg531" id="Pg531" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc296" id="toc296"></a>
times, but it wanted much to rouse her into activity.
The news of Antwerp's fall administered to her the
necessary incitement to deal "roundly and resolutely"
with her new allies. Fresh forces were despatched
to Flanders under the Earl of Leicester, making in
all some 10,000 men that had already been sent
thither, nearly one-fourth of which had been furnished
by the city of London.<a id="noteref_1642" name="noteref_1642" href="#note_1642"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1642</span></span></a> The queen grumbled at
having to send so many—"I have sent a fine heap

soldiers of the English nation," said she to the
envoys in October<a id="noteref_1643" name="noteref_1643" href="#note_1643"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1643</span></span></a>—and she kept the earl so short

being carried on in the Netherlands against Spain, a
new Catholic conspiracy against the life of Elizabeth,
with Anthony Babington at its head, was discovered
by Walsingham. The delight of the citizens
at the queen's escape drew forth from her a letter
which she desired to be read before the Common
Council, and in which she testified her appreciation
of their loyalty. The letter was introduced to the
council by some prefatory remarks made by James
Dalton, a member of the court, in which he expatiated
upon the beauties of the reformed Church<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page533">[pg 533]</span><a name="Pg533" id="Pg533" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc297" id="toc297"></a>

(1) the names of the ablest men for service, (2) the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The discovery had also another effect: it
brought the head of Mary Stuart to the block. A
commission of peers sitting at Fotheringhay found
that the conspiracy had been "with the privitie of
the said Marie pretending tytle to the crowne of the
realme of England," and it only remained for
Elizabeth to sign the warrant for her execution to
remove for ever a dangerous rival. This, however,
the queen long hesitated to do, and when at length
prevailed upon she caused public proclamation to be
made of the reasons which induced her to take the
extreme course.<a id="noteref_1652" name="noteref_1652" href="#note_1652"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1652</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After the execution of Mary Stuart, Philip of
Spain laid claim to the crown of England. For years
past he was known to have been preparing a fleet for
an invasion of the country. Preparations were now
almost complete, and in 1587 expectation was that
the fleet might be seen any day bearing down
upon the English coast. The inhabitants of villages
and towns on the south coast forsook their homes in
terror of the invasion and sought shelter inland.<a id="noteref_1656" name="noteref_1656" href="#note_1656"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1656</span></span></a>
The evil hour was put off by the prompt action of
Drake, who, with four ships of the royal navy and
twenty-four others supplied by the City and private
individuals,<a id="noteref_1657" name="noteref_1657" href="#note_1657"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1657</span></span></a> appeared suddenly off the Spanish coast,
and running into Cadiz and Lisbon, destroyed tons
of shipping under the very nose of the Spanish lord
high admiral, and threw into the sea the vast military
stores that had been accumulated there. Having
thus accomplished the object for which he set sail—that
of "singeing the king of Spain's beard"—he
returned, and the sailing of the Armada was put off
for a year.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Preparations were in the meanwhile pushed on
in the city to meet the attack whenever it should be
made. Ten thousand men were levied and equipped
in a short space of time.<a id="noteref_1658" name="noteref_1658" href="#note_1658"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1658</span></span></a> Any inhabitant of the city<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page535">[pg 535]</span><a name="Pg535" id="Pg535" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc298" id="toc298"></a>
assessed in the subsidy-book at £50 in goods, and
who, being under fifty years of age, was called upon
to serve, and refused, was forthwith committed to

city's force it was the inefficiency of its officers,
whom the municipal authorities always claimed to
appoint. The Earl of Leicester, who was in command
of the camp which had been formed at Tilbury, held
but a poor opinion of Londoners as a fighting force.<a id="noteref_1660" name="noteref_1660" href="#note_1660"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1660</span></span></a>
"For your Londoners," wrote the earl to Walsingham,<a id="noteref_1661" name="noteref_1661" href="#note_1661"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1661</span></span></a>
I see their service will be little, except they have
their own captains, and having them, I look for
none at all by them when we shall meet the
enemy." He declares that he knows what burghers
be well enough, even though they be "as brave and
well trained" as the Londoners; they would be
useless without good leaders,<a id="noteref_1662" name="noteref_1662" href="#note_1662"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1662</span></span></a> and on this he had
always insisted. He warns Walsingham against yielding
to the wishes of "townsmen" at such a critical
juncture, for they would look for the like concession
at other times. The Londoners were not peculiar
in their desire to have their own officers, according
to the earl's own showing, for the letter continues:—"You
and my lords all know the imperfection<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page536">[pg 536]</span><a name="Pg536" id="Pg536" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
at this time, how few leaders you have, and the
gentlemen of the counties here are likewise very
loth to have any placed with them to command
under them, but well pleased to have some expert
man with them to give them advice." Two years
later a code of regulations for the "trayninge of
capytaynes" was forwarded by the government to
the city, and there put into execution.<a id="noteref_1663" name="noteref_1663" href="#note_1663"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1663</span></span></a></p>

Nothing was said at the time about victualling the

Journal that they were victualled for three months.
On the 16th July the City agreed to supply victuals<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page537">[pg 537]</span><a name="Pg537" id="Pg537" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc299" id="toc299"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At last the blow fell. On Friday, the 19th (o.s.)
July, the Armada was sighted off the Lizard. A
strong wind from the south-west was blowing at the
time, and it was thought advisable to let the fleet
pass and to follow it up with the English vessels
then lying in Plymouth harbour. On the following
day the two fleets hove in sight of each other.
According to the report made to Walsingham by
Richard Tomson—a Londoner serving on board the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Margaret and John</span></span>, one of the ships furnished by the
City—the Spanish fleet numbered at that time 136
sail, ninety of which were large vessels, whilst the
English fleet numbered no more than sixty-seven.<a id="noteref_1667" name="noteref_1667" href="#note_1667"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1667</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Notwithstanding the great superiority of the
enemy's fleet in numbers and tonnage, the English
admiral, Lord Howard, opened fire the next morning,
but took care not to come to close quarters. "We
had some small fight with them that Sunday
afternoon," reported Hawkins to Walsingham.<a id="noteref_1668" name="noteref_1668" href="#note_1668"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1668</span></span></a>
The admiral had other reasons for preserving caution.
His ships were but ill-furnished with provisions and
with ammunition, and even thus early he had to beg
the Secretary of State to send him "for God's sake
some powder and shot."<a id="noteref_1669" name="noteref_1669" href="#note_1669"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1669</span></span></a> The same deficiency of
ammunition was experienced the whole time that<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page538">[pg 538]</span><a name="Pg538" id="Pg538" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the two fleets were opposed to each other, and but
for this the enemy would not have got off so cheaply
as it did. Scarcely a day passed without some
cannonading taking place, but never a general engagement.
The English trusted to their superior
seamanship and to the greater activity of their own
light vessels compared with the heavier and more
unwieldly Spanish galleons. Again and again they
poured broadside after broadside into the enemy, but
always making good their retreat before the Spanish
vessels could turn in pursuit. On Tuesday (23 July),
wrote Hawkins, they had "a sharp and long fight" off
Portland, on Thursday "a hot fraye." And thus the
Armada made its way up channel, pestered with the
swarm of English vessels that would never leave it at
peace. On the Saturday following (27 July) it finally
dropped anchor in Calais roads, with the intention of
awaiting there the arrival of Alexander Farnese with
his promised aid before making a direct descent upon
the English coast. Farnese did not arrive for the
reason that he was blockaded by the Dutch fleet;
but the English received an accession of strength by
the arrival of Lord Henry Seymour with a squadron
of sixteen ships, which hitherto had been lying off
Folkestone.<a id="noteref_1670" name="noteref_1670" href="#note_1670"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1670</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this juncture the lord mayor (Sir George
Bond), having received information of the critical
state of affairs and that a general engagement was
imminent, issued his precept to the aldermen to
summon the pastors and ministers of each ward, and
bid them call their parishioners to church by toll of<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page539">[pg 539]</span><a name="Pg539" id="Pg539" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc300" id="toc300"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After more than one consultation together, the
English commanders determined to resort to stratagem.
They sent for a number of useless hulks from Dover,
and having filled them with every kind of combustible,
sent them all aflame on Sunday night into the thick
of the enemy. The result was a panic; cables were
cut and frantic attempts made to escape what seemed
imminent and wholesale destruction. The ships fell
foul of each other; some were wrecked and others
burnt. When Monday morning dawned only eighty-six
vessels out of 124 that had anchored off Calais
thirty-six hours before could be found, and these for
the most part were seen driving towards the coast of
Flanders. The English fleet at once prepared to
follow in pursuit, but attention was for a time drawn
off to the action of the flagship of the squadron
of galeasses, a huge vessel which had become disabled
by loss of rudder, and the crew of which
were endeavouring by the aid of oars to bring
into Calais harbour. The Lord Admiral Howard at
once bore down upon her in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ark</span></span>, but the water
proved too shallow. The London ship <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Margaret
and John</span></span> followed suit and, although of less tonnage
than the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ark</span></span>, got aground. Richard Tomson sent<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page540">[pg 540]</span><a name="Pg540" id="Pg540" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
home a graphic account of the exploit that followed.<a id="noteref_1673" name="noteref_1673" href="#note_1673"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1673</span></span></a>
Both ships sent out long boats to capture the rich prize
as she lay stuck fast upon the harbour bar. Tomson
himself formed one of the little band of volunteers. The
boats were soon alongside the galeass, its huge sides
towering high above them. There then ensued "a
pretty skirmish for half-an-hour," wrote Tomson, "but
they seemed safely ensconced in their ships, while we
in our open pinnaces and far under them had nothing
to shroud and cover us." Fortune at last favoured the
attackers. The Spanish commander fell dead on his
deck with a bullet through his head. A panic seized
the sailors, most of whom jumped overboard and
tried by swimming and wading to reach the shore.
Some succeeded, but many were drowned; whilst
those who remained on board signified their readiness
to capitulate by hoisting a couple of "handkerchers"
on rapiers. The English lost no time in clambering
up the sides of the monster, and at once commenced
plundering the vessel and releasing the galley slaves.
They were only waiting for the tide to take their
prize in tow and carry her off when they were warned
by the governor of Calais against making any such
attempt. They were free to plunder the vessel if
they liked, but make prize of the vessel itself they
must not, and this order the governor showed
himself ready and able to enforce by opening fire
from the fort. Tomson and his fellow volunteers
were heartily disgusted at having after all to surrender
their prize, "the verye glory and staye of the Spanish
armye, a thing of very great value and strength."</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This exploit being ended and the long boats
having returned to their respective ships, the lord
admiral started in pursuit of the Spaniards. Seeing
them coming up the Spanish commander immediately
prepared for action. An engagement—described by
Hawkins as "a long and great fight"—took place off
Gravelines and lasted six hours. The English pursued
the same tactics as before, and with like success.
Without losing a single ship of their own they succeeded
in riddling the best Spanish ships through and
through, and at last the Armada was forced to bear
away towards the open sea. The English followed
and made a pretence of keeping up the attack, but by
this time nearly all their ammunition as well as food
had given out.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From Tuesday (30 July) until the following
Friday (2 Aug.) the pursuit was, nevertheless, maintained
by Howard, Drake and Frobisher. On Sunday
(4 Aug.) the strong south-wester which had prevailed
rose to a gale, and the English fleet made its way
home with difficulty. It was otherwise with the
Armada. Crippled and forlorn, without pilots and
without competent commander, the great fleet was
driven northward past the Hebrides and eventually
returned home in a decimated condition by the west
coast of Ireland.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime the civic authorities took order

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was a long time before any certain news
arrived in the city of the ultimate fate of the Armada.
There had been rumours abroad that the English fleet
had been victorious—with so many Londoners serving
in the fleet, it would have been strange indeed if their
friends at home had been kept in absolute ignorance
of what was taking place in the channel—and bonfires
had been lighted, but these rumours were often incorrect
and sometimes lead to mischief. The mayor
therefore issued his precept to the aldermen on the
30th July—the day after the engagement off Gravelines—bidding
them see that the inhabitants of their
several wards refrained from crediting any news that
might be reported of the vessels at sea but what they
received from the mayor himself. The precaution
was necessary "for the avoyding of some dislike that
may come thereof."<a id="noteref_1676" name="noteref_1676" href="#note_1676"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1676</span></span></a> On the 1st August, so critical
were the times, the mayor issued a precept by the
queen's orders forbidding householders to quit the
city, that they might the better be ready for the
queen's service if required.<a id="noteref_1677" name="noteref_1677" href="#note_1677"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1677</span></span></a> On the 4th the citizens

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first public notification of the complete destruction
of the Armada was made in a thanksgiving
sermon preached by the Dean of St. Paul's on Tuesday,
the 20th August, at Paul's Cross, in the presence
of the mayor and aldermen and the livery companies
in their best gowns.<a id="noteref_1679" name="noteref_1679" href="#note_1679"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1679</span></span></a> In November the queen resolved
to attend a public thanksgiving service at St. Paul's in
person, Monday, the 18th, being the day that was
originally fixed. Great preparations were made for
the occasion. The livery companies were ordered to
take up their appointed stations at eight o'clock in the
morning and to follow in the train of the royal
procession until the "preaching place" was reached.
Places were to be kept by a detachment of the
"yeomanry" of each company sent on at six o'clock
for that purpose. The "governors of the hospital"
of each company were also to attend, staff in hand,
and repair to the "skaffold" for them appointed.
After dinner the companies were to return immediately
to their stations and to wait there until her
majesty returned to Somerset House.<a id="noteref_1680" name="noteref_1680" href="#note_1680"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1680</span></span></a> The day
was afterwards changed from Monday, the 18th, to
Sunday, the 24th, when the queen came in great
state to St. Paul's. After prayers she took her
seat in a closet built out of the north wall of the
church and facing Paul's Cross, where she heard a
sermon preached by the Bishop of Salisbury. That
being over she was entertained at dinner in the<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page544">[pg 544]</span><a name="Pg544" id="Pg544" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whilst the City is justly proud of its own share
in the defence of the kingdom at this great crisis
in the nation's history, it has not neglected to give
honour where honour was most due. Of the great
naval commanders the "sea dogs" of that age—the
faces of at least two of them were familiar to the
citizens. Both Frobisher and Hawkins owned property
in the city, and in all probability resided there,
like their fellow seaman and explorer, Sir Humphrey
Gilbert, who was living in Red Cross Street, in
the parish of St. Giles, Cripplegate, in 1583, the
year that he met his death at sea.<a id="noteref_1682" name="noteref_1682" href="#note_1682"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1682</span></span></a> The same parish
claims Frobisher, whose remains (excepting his entrails,
which were interred at Plymouth, where he
died) lie buried in St. Giles's Church, and to whom a
mural monument was erected by the vestry in 1888,
just three centuries after the defeat of the Armada, to
which he had contributed so much. If Hawkins himself
did not reside in the city, his widow had a mansion
house in Mincing Lane.<a id="noteref_1683" name="noteref_1683" href="#note_1683"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1683</span></span></a> He, too, had probably
lived there, for although he died and was buried at
sea, a monument was erected to his memory and that
of Katherine, his first wife, in the church of St.
Dunstan-in-the-East.<a id="noteref_1684" name="noteref_1684" href="#note_1684"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1684</span></span></a> There is one other—a citizen

been handed down as having taken an active part in
the defence of the kingdom at this time, not at sea,
but on land. A monument in the recently restored
church of St. Helen, Bishopsgate, tells us that Martin
Bond, son of Alderman William Bond, "was captaine
in ye yeare 1588 at ye campe at Tilbury, and after
remained chief captaine of ye trained bands of this
citty until his death." The monument represents
him as sitting in a tent guarded by two sentinels, with
a page holding a horse.</p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">Disorganized state of the camp at Tilbury.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was well that the Spaniards suffered defeat at
sea, for had they been able to effect a landing they
would have made short work with the half-trained
and dissatisfied soldiers in the camp at Tilbury, and
London would have been at their mercy. Even the
presence of Elizabeth herself, riding on horseback
through the camp, as she did on the 8th August, was
but poor compensation to the soldiers for the want of
victuals and wages. Many sold their armour and
weapons to pay themselves as soon as the camp broke
up. Citizens of London were warned by royal proclamation
(20 Aug.)<a id="noteref_1685" name="noteref_1685" href="#note_1685"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1685</span></span></a> against purchasing armour and
weapons offered by soldiers, who were declared to
"have most falsly and slanderously given out that
they weare compelled to make sale of them for
that they receaved noe pay, which is most untruely
reported." Any armour or weapons bought before
publication of the proclamation was to be delivered
up to the mayor with particulars as to the way the
purchase had been effected and compensation would
be allowed.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Notwithstanding the extreme parsimony with
which Elizabeth had fitted out both army and navy,
the cost of preparations to meet the attack of Spain
had been great, and she was obliged to borrow money.
In September (1588) the City advanced her the sum
of £30,000, receiving her bond for repayment in the
following March; and in the following December she
borrowed a further sum of £20,000 to be repaid by
the following April. Both sums were raised among
the livery companies.<a id="noteref_1686" name="noteref_1686" href="#note_1686"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1686</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In March of the following year (1589) parliament
granted a liberal supply, but the grant was accompanied
by a request that Elizabeth would no longer
await the assaults of Spain, but carry the war into the
enemy's country. This the queen declared her inability
to undertake on the score of poverty. She
promised, however, to give what assistance she could
to any of her subjects who relished such enterprise.
Norris and Drake were at hand, ready and willing
to undertake the work on these terms. Already
(in January) the City had been called upon to furnish
them with 400 strong and able men.<a id="noteref_1687" name="noteref_1687" href="#note_1687"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1687</span></span></a> At the end of

and to bring them to the Leadenhall.<a id="noteref_1688" name="noteref_1688" href="#note_1688"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1688</span></span></a> With these

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again the city was threatened with danger and
disease from the presence of disbanded soldiers and
sailors, who were apt to carry their freebooting habits
wherever they went, more especially when starvation
stared them in the face. Sir Martin Calthorp did what
he could to relieve them, paying out of his own pocket
no less a sum than £100. His conduct was applauded
by the lords of the council, who authorised him to
raise a further sum towards assisting the soldiers to
their homes in the country by allowing them a half-penny
a mile.<a id="noteref_1689" name="noteref_1689" href="#note_1689"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1689</span></span></a></p>

Admiralty. Soldiers were to return to the country
where they had been pressed and apply to the justices
or other officers who pressed them, and who would
make a certificate to the lieutenant of the county,
when the soldiers would receive "reasonable contentment."<a id="noteref_1690" name="noteref_1690" href="#note_1690"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1690</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The revolution which followed the assassination
of the French king by Jaques Clements about this
time (Aug., 1589) brought fresh anxiety to Elizabeth,
who felt bound to support the Protestant Henry of
Navarre with all the means at her command, as an
indirect way of carrying on the war against Spain.
Four thousand men were to be despatched for his
assistance, 1,000 of whom the City was called upon
to supply. As they were to be picked men the lords
of the council ordered double the number, or 2,000 men,
to be got ready, in order that expert officers might
review them and select the number required.<a id="noteref_1693" name="noteref_1693" href="#note_1693"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1693</span></span></a>

wherever they took up their abode, and in whatsoever

So successful had been their efforts that Philip

Compton; but now he is out again, and by all
meanes seekes to hinder the match, alledging a

But upon his beating and misusing her she was
sequestred to one Barkers, a proctor, and from

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A few weeks after Spencer's confinement in the
Fleet we find him at variance with his brother aldermen
for digging a pit on his estate near "Canbury,"
or Canonbury, and thereby drawing off water which

£80,000.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His daughter, who inherited her father's money,
was possessed also of some of her father's spirit, and
Lord Compton appears to have got "a warme catch"
indeed to judge from a letter she addressed to him
soon after her father's death. After reminding her
"sweete life" of the care she had ever taken of his
estate and of her excellent behaviour, she begs him
to allow her £1,600 per annum, to be paid quarterly,
besides £600 a year for charitable works. She will
have three horses for her own saddle "that none
shall dare to lend or borrow; none lend but I, none
borrow but you." She will have so many gentlemen<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page555">[pg 555]</span><a name="Pg555" id="Pg555" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc307" id="toc307"></a>
and so many gentlewomen to wait upon her at home,
whilst riding, hunting, hawking or travelling. When
on the road she will have laundresses "sent away
with the carriages to see all safe," and chambermaids
sent before with the grooms that the chambers may
be ready, sweet and clean. Seeing that her requests
are so reasonable she expects her husband to find her
children in apparel and schooling, and all her servants
in wages. She concludes by declaring her will to
have her houses handsomely furnished, not omitting
"silver warming pans," warns her husband against
lending money to the lord chamberlain, and prays
him to increase her allowance and double her attendance
on his becoming an earl.<a id="noteref_1723" name="noteref_1723" href="#note_1723"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1723</span></span></a></p>

Sir Stephen Slaney, and the latter's year of office

City was expected to furnish sixteen ships and 10,000

extravagant, and after some remonstrance was reduced

being threatened with famine at the close of the year

which was practically a refusal to obey the commands

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It set forth the utter inability of the citizens,
however willing they might be, to supply more ships.
They had already expended on sea service alone,
and irrespective of their disbursements in 1588, no less
a sum than 100,000 marks within the last few years;
so that the lords of the council would see that the
citizens had not been wanting in good will and affection
towards] that service. The same good will still remained,
but there was lacking the like ability, owing
partly to former charges by sea and land, but more
especially to the great scarcity of victual which had
continued in the city for the past three years, and had
compelled many who had formerly been well off to
reduce their expenditure, whilst others had been
obliged to relinquish their trades and break up their
households. As a proof of the poverty existing in the
city their lordships were reminded that when wheat
was offered at a very moderate rate many were too
poor to purchase any. The wealthier sort would<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page558">[pg 558]</span><a name="Pg558" id="Pg558" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
therefore have to be called upon to subscribe towards
the maintenance of the poorer class, and so be rendered
less able to contribute to other demands. The
letter proceeded to draw their lordships' attention to
what after all was the reason which weighed most
with the citizens for refusing to contribute any more
to the naval service. "Besides theis defectes" wrote
the mayor and corporation "we may not conceale the
great discontentment and utter discouragement of

sufficient to defraye the charges of the whole voyage,
yet forasmuch as neither their principall nor any
parte thereof was restored unto them contrarie to
the meaninge of the contract set downe in writinge
under the signatures of two noble persons in her
highnes name, they are made hereby utterly unfitt
and indisposed for the like service to be done hereafter."<a id="noteref_1735" name="noteref_1735" href="#note_1735"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1735</span></span></a>
The Cadiz adventure—they went on to
say—had cost the City £1,900, a great part of which
sum was still not collected, whilst the City's Chamber
was already in debt to the extent of £14,000 and
utterly unable to afford relief. The writers, in conclusion,
expressed themselves ready to contribute<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page559">[pg 559]</span><a name="Pg559" id="Pg559" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc309" id="toc309"></a>

this arrangement they felt sure her majesty would be
well content.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What was the effect of this reply does not
appear; but in one respect the queen was more than
a match for the citizens. They had pleaded scarcity
of provisions and poverty as an excuse for not
carrying out her recent orders. Very good; let the
livery companies, whose duty it was to find men
and money when required, practise a little self-restraint
in the coming summer (1597). Let them,
she said, forbear giving feasts in their halls and
elsewhere, and bestow half the money thus saved
on the poor; and the order of the Court of Aldermen
went forth accordingly.<a id="noteref_1736" name="noteref_1736" href="#note_1736"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1736</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For some years past it had always been feared
lest Spain should again endeavour to strike at England
through Ireland. A rising in Ulster under Hugh
O'Neill, known in England as the Earl of Tyrone, in
1594 was followed by an appeal to Spain for help in
1595. Philip acceded to the request and another
Armada was got ready; but the fleet had scarcely put
to sea before it suffered a similar fate to the Armada
of 1588 and was shattered by a storm (Dec., 1596).
The Tyrone rebellion necessitated further calls on the
City for men and money. In May, 1597, it was asked
to furnish 500 men, such as Sir Samuel Bagnall might
approve of.<a id="noteref_1737" name="noteref_1737" href="#note_1737"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1737</span></span></a> In the following year—when Bagnall

In 1599 Elizabeth sent her favourite Essex to conquer
Ireland in good earnest, to prevent the country falling

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the meantime a report again got abroad that a
Spanish fleet was assembling at Brest for a descent on
England. On the 25th July, 1598, the lords of the
council wrote to the mayor calling upon him to see
that some twelve or sixteen vessels were provided
with ordnance and powder for the defence of the
Thames, and the court of Common Council at once
took the necessary steps for fitting out the ships as

raised to 6,000.<a id="noteref_1740" name="noteref_1740" href="#note_1740"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1740</span></span></a> The city's forces and the charge of

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The administration of Essex in Ireland was a
signal failure, and he made matters worse by quitting
his post without leave and forcing his presence upon
the queen. He had hoped to recover her good grace
by his unexpected appearance. Elizabeth was not
to be thus cajoled. She ordered him into custody,
deprived him of his offices, and, what was of more
importance to him, refused to renew his patent of a
monopoly of sweet wines. Although the earl soon
regained his liberty he could not forget his disgrace,
and his overweening vanity drove him to concert
measures against the government. In 1601 he rode
at the head of a few followers into the city, expecting
the citizens to rise in his favour. The mayor had,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page562">[pg 562]</span><a name="Pg562" id="Pg562" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
however, been forewarned, and 1,000 men were held
in readiness in each ward fully armed for the safeguard
of the city.<a id="noteref_1746" name="noteref_1746" href="#note_1746"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1746</span></span></a> The earl and his band proceeded
to the house of Thomas Smith, in Fenchurch Street,
one of the sheriffs, who had represented himself, or
been represented by others, as able and willing to
further the earl's cause. That the sheriff was thought
by his fellow citizens to have been implicated in
Essex's mad attempt is seen from the fact that within
a week he was deprived, not only of his sheriffwick,
but also of his aldermanry,<a id="noteref_1747" name="noteref_1747" href="#note_1747"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1747</span></span></a> but to what extent he
had compromised himself it is difficult to determine.
Finding the citizens averse to a rising and his passage
stopped by pikemen under the command of Sir John
Gilbert and Sir Robert Cross, who respectively had
charge of Ludgate and Newgate,<a id="noteref_1748" name="noteref_1748" href="#note_1748"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1748</span></span></a> and who refused
to surrender them except to the sheriff in person as
the queen's representative, the earl and his company
hastened to the riverside and returned to Essex House
by water. He was subsequently arrested and committed
to the Tower, together with two of his
accomplices, the Earls of Rutland and Southampton.
Another of his followers, the Earl of Bedford, was
committed for a while to the custody of Leonard
Holiday, a city alderman.<a id="noteref_1749" name="noteref_1749" href="#note_1749"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1749</span></span></a> The queen, who had

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A sum of £200 was distributed by the civic

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lord Mountjoy, who had succeeded Essex in
Ireland, set to work systematically to bring the
country into complete submission. The conquest
was not effected without considerable aid from the
city of London. From 1600 to 1602 the citizens
were being constantly called upon to supply fresh
forces for Ireland.<a id="noteref_1755" name="noteref_1755" href="#note_1755"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1755</span></span></a> A Spanish force which at length
came to Tyrone's assistance in 1601, and established
itself at Kinsale, was compelled to surrender. The
work of the sword was supplemented by famine;
until at last Tyrone himself was carried in triumph to
Dublin, and the conquest of Ireland was complete.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mountjoy's work could not be carried on without
money, and Elizabeth had been compelled in 1601 to
summon a parliament to obtain supplies. Hitherto
the Puritans, who began in the early part of the
reign to gain a hold in the House of Commons, and
had gradually increased in strength, had been content,
in the presence of a common danger, to refrain from
offering any systematic opposition to Elizabeth's
government. But now that the defeat of the
Armada, the death of Philip II and the firm
establishment of Henry IV on the throne of France
had removed all danger from abroad, they began to
change front. As soon as the House met the
Commons chose Croke (or Crooke), the City's
Recorder, their Speaker, an honour which the City
acknowledged by ordering (3 Nov.) a gift of forty
marks to be made to him.<a id="noteref_1756" name="noteref_1756" href="#note_1756"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1756</span></span></a> When the question of
supplies came before the House they were readily
granted, but a bill was introduced to abolish patents
of monopolies, which the queen had been in the habit
of lavishly bestowing upon her favourites by virtue of
her prerogative, and by which the price of nearly
every commodity had been grievously enhanced. It
was in vain that the minority in the House
found fault with the Speaker for allowing the
queen's prerogative to be called in question. The
majority had the nation at its back; and finding
this to be the case Elizabeth, who knew when
to give way, yielded with grace. When a deputation
of the Commons waited upon her and
expressed the gratitude of the House at her concession,
she replied in words full of kindness and<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page565">[pg 565]</span><a name="Pg565" id="Pg565" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><a name="toc312" id="toc312"></a>
dignity, thanking the Commons for having pointed
out her error, and calling God to witness that she
had never cherished anything but what tended to
her people's good, "Though you have had," she
assured them, "and may have, many princes more
mighty and wise sitting in this seat, yet you never
had, or ever shall have, any that will be more
careful and loving."</p>

<div class="tei tei-marginnote tei-marginnote-margin"><div class="tei tei-marginnotetext"><span style="font-size: 80%">The last days of Elizabeth, 1601-1603.</span></div></div>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These were the last words addressed by the
queen to her people, and their truth was borne out by
her conduct throughout her long reign. Under her
the country had become united and prosperous. By
the citizens of London she was especially beloved, for
they always found in her a supporter of trade and
commerce. If the Hanseatic towns behaved unfairly
to the merchant adventurers Elizabeth promptly
retaliated upon the merchants of the Steelyard.
She had threatened to close the Steelyard altogether
in 1578, when English merchants were ordered
to quit Hamburg, and twenty years later (1598),
when fresh difficulties had arisen, the threat was
carried out.<a id="noteref_1757" name="noteref_1757" href="#note_1757"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1757</span></span></a></p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The queen rarely left London to make one of
her many gorgeous progresses from country house to
country house or returned home without some notice
being sent to the city to allow of its inhabitants taking
"the comfort of behoulding her royall persone."<a id="noteref_1758" name="noteref_1758" href="#note_1758"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1758</span></span></a>
Her love of personal admiration and of handsome
men continued to the last. As late as November,<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page566">[pg 566]</span><a name="Pg566" id="Pg566" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
1602, she commanded the mayor and aldermen and a
number of the "best and most grave" citizens to
attend her from Chelsea to Westminster, and the
mayor, knowing her weakness, ordered the livery
companies to choose the "most grave and comlie"
members to join the procession.<a id="noteref_1759" name="noteref_1759" href="#note_1759"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1759</span></span></a> In the early
morning of the 24th March, 1603, she died at
Richmond, to the sincere regret of the citizens no
less than of the nation at large.</p>

Some, like
Kemble, refer it to the Lat. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">portus</span></span>, in the sense of an enclosed place
for sale or purchase, a market. ("Portus est conclusus locus, quo
importantur merces et inde exportantur. Est et statio conclusa
et munita."—Thorpe, i, 158). Others, like Dr. Stubbs (Const.
Hist., i, 404 n.), connect it with Lat. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">porta</span></span>, not in its restricted
signification of a gate, but as implying a market place, markets being
often held at a city's gates. The Latin terms <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">porta</span></span> and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">portus</span></span> were in
fact so closely allied, that they both alike signified a market place or a
gate. Thus, in the will of Edmund Harengeye, enrolled in the Court
of Husting, London, we find the following: "Ac eciam lego et volo
quod illa tenementa cum magno portu vocato le Brodegate ...

in the following year, when Brembre succeeded to his mayoralty, and
the so-called "king's party" was again in the ascendant, Philipot again
appears as alderman of his old ward, continuing in office until his death

is no evidence of this in the City's Records, although there appears to
have been a disturbance at his re-election in 1384. It may be to this
that the Mercers' petition refers. It is noteworthy that at the time of
his election in 1383, Brembre was not an alderman, although in the previous
year, and again in the year following his election, he is recorded as

furnished thirty ships and 10,000 men. At the same time there does

            machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment
            including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are
            particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the
            IRS.</p><p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
            charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
            States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
            considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
            with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
            we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
            DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
